<time datetime=2024-07-01 class=text-muted>Monday, July 01, 2024</time></div><header class=article-meta></header><p>Welcome to The Bootloader. I&rsquo;m Paul Cutler.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m Tod Kurt. We have a special episode for you today with an interview with Justin</p><p>Myers, the author of the CircuitPython Library Connection Manager. Before we get to that,</p><p>though, Paul and I each have a couple of things to share with you, each not more than a few</p><p>minutes long. What&rsquo;s your first one, Paul?</p><p>My first one is how to level up at CircuitPython. Professor John Gallaugher of Boston College</p><p>recently released two videos I wanted to share, one for how to migrate from using Mu and</p><p>CircuitPython to using PyCharm with Teal and a video on using Circup to install and update</p><p>CircuitPython libraries. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Professor Gallaugher, I talked to him</p><p>way back in episode 3 of the CircuitPython Show, which I&rsquo;ll link to in the show notes.</p><p>He teaches a class called Introduction to Physical Computing, which uses CircuitPython</p><p>along with microcontrollers to teach students computing concepts. He has other YouTube playlists</p><p>worth checking out on his YouTube channel, especially if you&rsquo;re newer to CircuitPython.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll link to those as well.</p><p>But back to his new videos. The first one is how to correctly set up PyCharm on MacOS</p><p>to use with CircuitPython. Most of this is applicable to Linux, too, and I learned a</p><p>few new things. It&rsquo;s a longer video at about half an hour, but the professor walks you</p><p>through how to correctly configure PyCharm, and he&rsquo;s using the free community edition</p><p>in the video. Next, he covers using the new and updated CircuitPython setboard so you</p><p>have code completion for your microcontroller in PyCharm. That might be brand new to a lot</p><p>of people and is definitely worth watching. From there, he covers using Teal, an open</p><p>source serial program that is way better than using Screen. It&rsquo;s got auto-reconnect as</p><p>its killer feature, and I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool that he included Teal as the serial monitor</p><p>in Mu is one of its key features.</p><p>Next up is a 15-minute video on using CircUp to install CircuitPython libraries. If you&rsquo;ve</p><p>used CircuitPython, chances are you&rsquo;ve downloaded the Adafruit library or the community library</p><p>bundle, and then you have to find the right library out of hundreds. But what if you could</p><p>easily use the command line? He walks you through how to use CircUp from the command</p><p>line, and then for Mac OS users or for Linux users using the ZSH shell, he shows you how</p><p>to add tab completion by updating your ZSH configuration file.</p><p>CircUp has also been getting some love over the last few months. Shout out to Tim, aka</p><p>Foamy Guy in the Adafruit community. He&rsquo;s been doing some refactoring and adding new</p><p>features as well. I know I learned a few things, and if you use CircuitPython and you&rsquo;re looking</p><p>to level up your CircuitPython workflow, I highly recommend checking out these videos</p><p>from Professor Gallaugher.</p><p>I love CircUp. It&rsquo;s sort of like, if you&rsquo;ve never heard of it, it&rsquo;s sort of like Pip,</p><p>the Python package manager, but for CircuitPython. And it hooks into the two big package repositories</p><p>that exist for CircuitPython, the Adafruit one and the community one. It&rsquo;s so good, but</p><p>it&rsquo;s a little bit hard to set up if you&rsquo;ve never done any sort of Python setup before.</p><p>So this video is like super handy because I get people asking me all the time, &ldquo;How</p><p>do you install a CircuitPython library?&rdquo;</p><p>Right.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;The answer is just use CircUp.&rdquo; But then the question becomes, &ldquo;Well, how</p><p>do you install CircUp?&rdquo;</p><p>And I think it&rsquo;s really cool that he actually walks you through on how to update your ZSH</p><p>shell for the tab autocompletes, because there&rsquo;s hundreds of libraries, and it makes it just</p><p>that much easier to find the library you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>I really want to follow his steps on how to set up that PyCharm IDE, because I don&rsquo;t really</p><p>use IDEs in the normal sense. I just use a text editor with code syntax highlighting.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s so many people that have been trying to use the VS Code CircuitPython extension,</p><p>and it&rsquo;s been sort of perennially broken.</p><p>The people are so frustrated using it. And it looks like PyCharm is really well done.</p><p>And there&rsquo;s this nice now intro video on how to actually meld it with CircuitPython, which</p><p>is a little weird because most of the times when you&rsquo;re editing Python with an IDE, you&rsquo;re</p><p>editing the files sort of in a project, say.</p><p>And CircuitPython is a little bit different in that the code lives on a device, and you</p><p>edit the device.</p><p>And so maybe your actual project is in a GitHub repo that lives on your computer somewhere.</p><p>So how do you deal with those two separate views of your code?</p><p>And I think PyCharm can help you with that.</p><p>It can, but you&rsquo;re still writing directly to the microcontroller in the way that it&rsquo;s</p><p>set up in this example.</p><p>Because I know I use PyCharm, and I did learn a couple of things, but there&rsquo;s still a lot</p><p>of copy-paste.</p><p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p>Because I commit everything to my GitHub repo, so I&rsquo;m writing locally, saving it there, and</p><p>then copying it over to the drive as soon as I hit save, running the code.</p><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s usually how I work as well.</p><p>But I see all these people that try to use Mu, because it&rsquo;s easy to use, but Mu&rsquo;s getting</p><p>kind of crusty.</p><p>And Thonny, I don&rsquo;t know, Thonny just always seems like it breaks my CircuitPython install</p><p>whenever I try to use it.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s too bad that Mu&rsquo;s getting a little long in the tooth.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an open source project, it needs a little love, but it&rsquo;s nice to see other alternatives</p><p>out there that are well documented.</p><p>Yeah, no doubt.</p><p>Yeah, I mean, the cool thing is that because it&rsquo;s all just a text file, you can use anything</p><p>that can edit text files to edit your CircuitPython code.</p><p>But it&rsquo;d be nice to have a really good IDE for those people who need IDEs.</p><p>What&rsquo;s your first one?</p><p>All right, so kind of related, Professor Gallaugher also does a lot of how to program iOS apps</p><p>for Apple devices.</p><p>And so those are written in Swift.</p><p>Swift is a programming language that Apple has been developing for the last 10 years.</p><p>They use it on all their platforms.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the officially recommended way for writing apps for iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch, things</p><p>like that.</p><p>And Swift is a really interesting language.</p><p>It&rsquo;s heavily influenced by Haskell and Rust, these sort of academic languages that emphasize</p><p>type safety and functional programming, where the compiler itself can catch a lot of bugs</p><p>as it compiles your code down, which is kind of foreign to how Python and JavaScript work,</p><p>where you just kind of run your code and see if it crashes or not.</p><p>And so there&rsquo;s this whole academic effort in computer science that we should be able</p><p>to make provably correct programs, or programs that we can prove will not crash for certain</p><p>classes of crashes.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what Haskell and Rust kind of comes from.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where Swift came from as well.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s a really interesting language.</p><p>It looks a little bit like C, but with all these sort of extra neat things on top of</p><p>it.</p><p>If you look at Chris Lattner, who developed LLVM and the Clang compiler, which you&rsquo;ve</p><p>probably seen in various places when you&rsquo;ve installed things, it&rsquo;s been the sort of revolution</p><p>how to compile C-based or C-like languages.</p><p>And so you&rsquo;ll see, I think you&rsquo;ll see LLVM and Clang a lot more going forward.</p><p>But Swift uses those two things underneath to do its magic as well.</p><p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m bringing all this up is because Apple just released something they</p><p>call Embedded Swift, which is a version of Swift that runs on microcontrollers, which</p><p>is amazing.</p><p>This is a super high-level language, in many ways higher level than Python or JavaScript.</p><p>And we can run it on a microcontroller on things that are even some ways smaller than</p><p>what CircuitPython type controllers can do.</p><p>And not only did they release here&rsquo;s Embedded Swift, but they also released working demos</p><p>for the Raspberry Pi Pico, the ESP32C6, the InterF52-840, which is a Beely chip, and the</p><p>STM32 chips.</p><p>And they&rsquo;ve also released a bunch of examples on how to participate in Matter, a Matter</p><p>network, which is the new standard for home automation that Apple&rsquo;s HomeKit API does.</p><p>And I think Google&rsquo;s Echo platform also does now.</p><p>And so there&rsquo;s a, and it&rsquo;s all on GitHub, you can just go to their Swift Matter examples,</p><p>see the smart light example that you can run and control.</p><p>You can make a controllable smart light with Siri and about 60 lines of Swift code.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s all, it has a lot of the same features of real Swift of the type safety, the functional</p><p>programming, that kind of stuff.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s just sort of amazing that we&rsquo;re getting this super high-level language running on</p><p>tiny chips.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ve not looked at it too much yet, but in the show notes, there&rsquo;ll be some links</p><p>to some other articles describing it and links to the GitHub that has some examples.</p><p>So you can actually try some of this stuff out on your Pico or ESP32.</p><p>I only know Python, and this has me really intrigued, especially the Matter integration,</p><p>right?</p><p>We don&rsquo;t have that in CircuitPython yet.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think Arduino has Matter integration that I&rsquo;ve seen.</p><p>So actually being able to write my own smart home apps on microcontrollers would be a really</p><p>cool use case and actually has me thinking of learning a second language.</p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, supposedly there&rsquo;s Matter APIs in the latest ESP IDF, the SDK that you</p><p>use when you&rsquo;re writing C code for the ESP32 chips.</p><p>And I think that&rsquo;s what these Swift Matter examples are using under the hood.</p><p>But do you really want to be mucking around with C code when you could use a high-level</p><p>language like Swift?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;d be nice if we get Matter support in CircuitPython someday.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t.</p><p>And I think Jeffler might actually be working on that really, really early stages.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p>I would love to see that.</p><p>All right, Paul, what&rsquo;s your number two?</p><p>My number two is accessibility matters.</p><p>When I first started contributing to open source about 20 years ago, one of the first</p><p>projects I contributed to was the GNOME project, the Linux desktop environment.</p><p>One of the core pieces of GNOME&rsquo;s culture is accessibility, which includes everything</p><p>from the Orca screen reader to how we wrote documentation back then.</p><p>You know, the worst disability that I have personally is being extremely colorblind,</p><p>but that focus on accessibility has always stuck with me, which is why I&rsquo;m excited to</p><p>see a project like this.</p><p>The first is the AccessBit from Dr. John Vidler in the UK.</p><p>The Micro:bit Educational Foundation commissioned a report on accessibility, which included</p><p>a speculative section on how to improve the Micro:bit platform for those with limited or</p><p>different mobility.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Micro:bit, it&rsquo;s a microcontroller primarily made for</p><p>education, popular in the UK and Australia, that features two buttons, a 5x5 LED grid,</p><p>and connections for alligator clips.</p><p>It can run MicroPython, CircuitPython, and MakeCode.</p><p>The report included a few sketches and possible solutions for potential 3.5 millimeter audio</p><p>jacks, which are the industry de facto standard for accessibility, like what are found on</p><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Adaptive Controller.</p><p>Dr. Vidler decided to design a PCB as a minimum viable product to add five adaptive switches.</p><p>He walks through various iterations of his design, landing on a final design that includes</p><p>an edge connector to connect to the Micro:bit and room for five 3.5 millimeter jacks.</p><p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool the thought that he put into the design, from how the add-on board connects</p><p>using the 40 pin Micro:bit controller to the curved design of the board.</p><p>He had JLCPCB make a handful of boards and sent them off, and they were shown at the</p><p>Blockly Summit in Cambridge earlier in June.</p><p>Check out the show notes to the link to his blog post detailing the process, including</p><p>photos.</p><p>The second product is a new Adafruit product, the TRRS Trinkey.</p><p>Adafruit&rsquo;s Trinkey line includes a USB-A port to plug it into a host computer, and a small</p><p>board maybe the size of a flash drive, so it&rsquo;s pretty small.</p><p>The TRRS Trinkey has a SAMD21 chip, has one 3.5 millimeter jack, and can run CircuitPython</p><p>or Arduino.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s great that those who might need it have more options for accessibility, especially</p><p>using microcontrollers, which they can program to their needs.</p><p>I&rsquo;m excited to see what people can think up using tech like this, especially if it makes</p><p>their lives easier.</p><p>These are a great sort of combo, because the Adafruit TRRS Trinkey is purely just a USB device.</p><p>It looks like a little USB thumb drive almost, it just has a 3.5 millimeter jack on the back.</p><p>But the Micro:bit, it has Bluetooth.</p><p>It has USB as well, but it has Bluetooth.</p><p>And so you can now make a Bluetooth accessible controller with this little add-on board by</p><p>just snicking the Micro:bit into it, and then plugging in some of these accessibility controllers</p><p>into that, and then pairing it with your phone with a little bit of code, with make code</p><p>or something.</p><p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p><p>I think there&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun things being created with this.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>What&rsquo;s your next one?</p><p>So my next one is about CAD query.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ve been on a journey to move to open source tools for my engineering work.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before I&rsquo;ve gone from using Eagle to KiCAD.</p><p>I use Fusion 360 for my 3D CAD modeling, and it&rsquo;s pretty good, but I&rsquo;m always irritated</p><p>after using it for a lot of different reasons.</p><p>What are the open source alternatives?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re going for a gooey 3D experience, there&rsquo;s things like Blender, but I like parametric</p><p>modeling.</p><p>One of the nice things that Fusion 360 does is you can make everything parametric, where</p><p>you just define a set of constraints, and then you create solid bodies from those constraints.</p><p>Blender&rsquo;s not really that.</p><p>Blender&rsquo;s more of like an artist&rsquo;s tool.</p><p>It can do a little bit of it.</p><p>So for the longest time, there&rsquo;s been this thing called OpenSCAD, which is a textual</p><p>3D parametric modeler.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s a gooey app where you&rsquo;ve got two panes.</p><p>One pane is the text of the OpenSCAD language you write to create cubes and pyramids and</p><p>cones and ways to combine them in different ways to make your 3D object.</p><p>And then on the right is a render of what that thing looks like.</p><p>And so from that, you can, and people have done this to great effect, make enclosures</p><p>and other 3D things that can be 3D printed.</p><p>Like I think all of the Prusa components in the Prusa 3D printers are all actual SCAD</p><p>models that somebody has designed as text files.</p><p>And so if you need to make the screw holes a little bigger because you&rsquo;re building it</p><p>by hand and you&rsquo;re 3D printing the pieces and you only have M5 screws instead of M3</p><p>screws, you can maybe just go into the OpenSCAD file and change one little parameter and change</p><p>all the screw hole sizes.</p><p>But I&rsquo;ve always bristled at OpenSCAD because it&rsquo;s got its own special language.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ve been looking at other things.</p><p>And I just discovered recently this thing that&rsquo;s been around for a long time called</p><p>CAD Query, which is like OpenSCAD, but it&rsquo;s all in Python.</p><p>It uses standard Python syntax, and it is mostly a library that you can then express</p><p>via various ways.</p><p>You can just run a main.py and have that output a file, but you can also run this thing called</p><p>CQ Editor, which is a GUI editor, kind of like the OpenSCAD editor where you have multiple</p><p>windows and you can edit text in one and see a render in the other window.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ve been using that and it&rsquo;s kind of working.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know, even though I&rsquo;ve been using CircuitPython for so many years, I&rsquo;m still</p><p>not a very good Python person.</p><p>So this is like kind of diving into more Python.</p><p>The reason why I discovered this is Luke Wren, who is one of the ASIC designers, sorry, at</p><p>Raspberry Pi.</p><p>He&rsquo;s one who has helped us do some of the clever PIO things that we&rsquo;ve done with the</p><p>Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, like the cool SynthIO and PWM and touch sensors and stuff is all</p><p>kind of because, oh, and most especially the HDMI output from a little $4 microcontroller</p><p>is because of some of his hints that he&rsquo;s given us.</p><p>But he has a GitHub repo of a bunch of CAD query files.</p><p>So if you want to see how CAD query things look, what the Python looks like, you can</p><p>just go to his repository and go, oh, look, there&rsquo;s a little vacuum adapter and here&rsquo;s</p><p>an air duct plate or whatever.</p><p>So there&rsquo;s a nice little library of things for you to kind of browse through and see</p><p>what CAD query feels like from a language point of view.</p><p>But one of the best things about CAD query is that unlike OpenSCAD and unlike the similar</p><p>OpenJS CAD, which is the same thing as OpenSCAD in some ways, but with JavaScript, CAD query</p><p>outputs step files, which are object files, not STLs, which are like tessellated, triangulated</p><p>shapes.</p><p>And I was really frustrated that like OpenSCAD doesn&rsquo;t have a step export feature because</p><p>if you have a step file, you can now import that into another CAD program like Fusion</p><p>360 and then do additional edits on it.</p><p>Whereas it&rsquo;s really hard to do edits on meshes.</p><p>The STL format is made for just output, for 3D printing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like the bitmap version of your vector file.</p><p>And so having a step is really important to me.</p><p>And so, yeah, so I&rsquo;m going to be playing with CAD query over the next whatever months or</p><p>so and see if I do anything with it.</p><p>I share your excitement for that.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, Python is the only language I know.</p><p>So looking through some of those examples, it&rsquo;s started to click for me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried to use OpenSCAD and never could figure it out.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t use FreeCAD because they don&rsquo;t have a colorblind mode and Fusion 360, I&rsquo;ve never</p><p>really gotten the hang of.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had some luck with Onshape, but actually having the ability to actually program it</p><p>is and with the examples that they&rsquo;ve got, looks really cool.</p><p>Thanks, Tod.</p><p>And now we have a special guest, Justin Myers.</p><p>Back in episode seven for the CircuitPython 9 release show we did, I mentioned Connection</p><p>Manager, but kind of guessed how it worked.</p><p>Well, I reached out to the author of the new library, Justin Myers, and asked him about</p><p>it.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the interview.</p><p>Justin, welcome to the show.</p><p>Thanks, Paul.</p><p>I&rsquo;m excited to be here.</p><p>To be honest, it&rsquo;s my first time I&rsquo;ve been on a podcast, so I&rsquo;m really excited about</p><p>it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re here.</p><p>What is the new CircuitPython library Connection Manager and what was your inspiration in creating</p><p>it?</p><p>Yeah, so basically late 2023, I had decided to spend some of my, let&rsquo;s call it extra time</p><p>working on CircuitPython and trying to see how I could help project.</p><p>I love the open source community.</p><p>And as I was kind of watching the threads, I just saw kind of user after user on Discord</p><p>having different connection issues, running out of sockets, different things like that,</p><p>memories issues and everything.</p><p>And I was like, &ldquo;Hmm, seems strange.</p><p>Should be a better way.&rdquo;</p><p>And so as I kind of started digging in, saw like each library kind of managed sockets</p><p>differently and really think about and look at the differences between like a microcontroller</p><p>and CPython running on a PC is like on CPython, you can open sockets all day long, nothing</p><p>really happens.</p><p>But then once you get to a microcontroller, it&rsquo;s different.</p><p>And kind of once I started digging into that, I was like, &ldquo;Oh, well, you&rsquo;ve got the native</p><p>Wi-Fi that does it one way.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve got like the ESP32 SPI that does it one way.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve got the WISNET 5K that does it a different way.&rdquo;</p><p>And just kind of all this boilerplate and different ways to get the SSL connection and</p><p>different things.</p><p>And I was like, &ldquo;This is weird.</p><p>Like there should be an easier way to do this.&rdquo;</p><p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of what started me going down this road of trying to find out like,</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a better way to do this?&rdquo;</p><p>And what was the better way?</p><p>So basically kind of the flow went, I asked the comment on the CircuitPython dev channel</p><p>and Discord.</p><p>I said, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve got this idea.&rdquo;</p><p>Basically the requests library had this built-in session manager that kind of managed a bunch</p><p>of the sockets.</p><p>But oftentimes what users would do is they would just re-init that thing and lose all</p><p>the sockets.</p><p>And so they were still technically open, just sitting there.</p><p>And so kind of that first pass was I basically kind of separated some of that out to a separate</p><p>class and kind of shared that with the devs.</p><p>And they were like, &ldquo;Nope, let&rsquo;s create a new library.</p><p>Like that&rsquo;s not a good way to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Kind of break up dependencies and everything like that.</p><p>And kind of from that, there&rsquo;s literally days spent kind of back and forth on like, &ldquo;What</p><p>should we name this?&rdquo;</p><p>And so ConnectionManager was kind of where that was born and basically just started separating</p><p>a bunch of the stuff out of what was in the request library and put it into this new one.</p><p>And then building handlers that would take in whatever radio object you passed in and</p><p>try to determine, &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s the right SSL method for this one?&rdquo;</p><p>Reducing imports from five or six all the way down to just the one or two that were</p><p>needed.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s really the key, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>If you have a PicoW, it was doing it different than an ESP32 S3.</p><p>And now for the user, that setup instantiation is almost the same across the different microcontrollers.</p><p>Is that right?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>And that was kind of the goal, right?</p><p>Because if you think through how CircuitPython started and once connection happened, so the</p><p>ESP32 Spy was one of the first ones, developers wrote that library and then they kind of mimicked</p><p>it a little bit for the Wiznet 5K.</p><p>And then when the new ones came out, like ESP32 S2 and S3 and things, and they started</p><p>having this onboard wifi, they changed how they did it again.</p><p>And with anything that&rsquo;s open source, they&rsquo;re running forward as fast as they can.</p><p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to go backwards to go update everything.</p><p>There were depreciation flags and comments, not flags in the code.</p><p>And all of these places were like, &ldquo;Oh, we should get rid of this at some point,&rdquo; but</p><p>it was still there like years or months later.</p><p>And so a lot of it was like trying to trim some of that down.</p><p>What was it like to partner with the core developers on Connection Manager?</p><p>I really enjoyed it.</p><p>It was really interesting.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a really interesting progress for me.</p><p>So a lot of my development started in C, 20 plus years ago when I started doing dev.</p><p>And a lot of it was for smaller systems.</p><p>And it was at a time where you had to do memory management and really think of your code for</p><p>what&rsquo;s going to be the fastest and most efficient ways.</p><p>And last 20 years, I&rsquo;ve switched over to things like Python and things where&mldr;</p><p>And JavaScript and everything, where a lot of that stuff&rsquo;s just handled for you and you</p><p>forget about it.</p><p>And so it&rsquo;s actually been really fun because they&rsquo;ll make comments on PRs and they&rsquo;re like,</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s a wasteful way to do something,&rdquo; because there&rsquo;s not a lot of space.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s really small and trying to think through it.</p><p>But they&rsquo;ve been great.</p><p>There&rsquo;s been times where a handful of them, we&rsquo;ve jumped on calls together to work through</p><p>some things and figure it out.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve been great on the comments and asking questions and whatnot.</p><p>And so I think the CircuitPython devs, it&rsquo;s a great team to work with.</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s great to hear.</p><p>What&rsquo;s next for you and Connection Manager?</p><p>Kind of where I&rsquo;ve been going next, I&rsquo;ve been opening a handful of PRs to make the radios</p><p>again more similar.</p><p>So for example, they all had different ways to find out what AP am I connected to?</p><p>What&rsquo;s my Mac address?</p><p>And different methods of returning everything.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ve been continuously working to try to get the different radios as close to the same</p><p>as possible.</p><p>And so really for an idea of&mldr;</p><p>A typical user probably goes out and they buy a microcontroller that&rsquo;s got whatever</p><p>Wi-Fi has on it, and they go run with that project and go.</p><p>But oftentimes they see a lot of the questions are someone sees a learn guide and they&rsquo;re</p><p>like, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t have that stuff that&rsquo;s in the learn guide.</p><p>I have this.&rdquo;</p><p>But then they really struggle to try to figure out how to get it all to work because these</p><p>different methods are different.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s really been working to get all those core methods the same.</p><p>So you can, for the most part, copy paste other than initializing the radio itself.</p><p>And the work I&rsquo;m doing currently now is I&rsquo;m actually building out some network test code</p><p>that we can run.</p><p>And so every time a new version of requests comes out or 9.1 for CircuitPython or 9.2</p><p>or 10 or whatnot, we can actually run the same test code across the same different microcontrollers</p><p>and actually figure out like, &ldquo;Oh, is SSL still working?</p><p>Can I still connect to MQTT?</p><p>Can I run a server?</p><p>Can I do requests?&rdquo;</p><p>And ideally with a goal of having a kind of similar to CSS is that this like, &ldquo;Can I use?&rdquo;</p><p>Like so you could go look and be like, &ldquo;I have this microcontroller.</p><p>I&rsquo;m using this radio and I want to do this.</p><p>Can I do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s great.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been fun and exciting to watch you partner with the core devs as you&rsquo;ve built this over</p><p>the last few months.</p><p>Thank you so much for being on the show.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>I really appreciate it.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s our show.</p><p>A special thanks to Justin Myers.</p><p>If you enjoy listening to the show, tell a friend or write a review.</p><p>It really does help.</p><p>For detailed show notes and transcripts, visit thebootloader.net.</p><p>Until next time, stay positive.</p><p>[Music]</p><ul
