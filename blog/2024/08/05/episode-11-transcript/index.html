Tod and I each have a couple of</p><p>interesting things to share with you, and you&rsquo;ll want to stay till the end of the episode for a</p><p>special announcement. But first we have a special interview with Debra Ansell. Debra is known</p><p>for her work with LEDs and you can find her at geekmomprojects.com. She also goes by Geek Mom</p><p>Projects on Instagram and Mastodon, which I&rsquo;ll link to in the show notes. Debra, welcome to</p><p>the show. You were at Teardown 2024 this past June. Tell me about Teardown.</p><p>Hi, Paul, thanks. And it was a wonderful experience. I still have, you know, warm fuzzy</p><p>flashbacks to moments that happened there. So I&rsquo;m really happy to talk about it. It was</p><p>unreservedly the best MakerCon I have attended. Now I haven&rsquo;t attended a wide variety of them,</p><p>but I&rsquo;ve attended a number. And I think there were a confluence of factors that made it such a fun,</p><p>enjoyable, stimulating, welcoming event. So that&rsquo;s an open ended question. But I&rsquo;ll start with</p><p>for people who don&rsquo;t know what Teardown is, I strongly recommend finding and maybe you can link</p><p>to this on your website, an interview that Helen Leigh had with David Groom about what Teardown is</p><p>and what goes into it, because she gives a really good explainer from an insider&rsquo;s perspective. So</p><p>I will probably, you know, misstate the purpose of it and all that. But from my perspective, it was</p><p>a place to go, bring some projects, find people who are interested in similar projects or might</p><p>have different interests, but that are in the same world space that really are happy to talk about</p><p>them and want to share them and, you know, meet like minded people and kind of see what&rsquo;s going</p><p>on in the community in person where you can have real conversations one on one or in small groups.</p><p>And it was a really wonderful combination of attending talks, hanging out with friends who I</p><p>had a group of friends whom I knew would be there, meeting new people from a wide range of backgrounds</p><p>and circumstances, and, you know, meeting some people I&rsquo;d met only online and meeting some people</p><p>I&rsquo;d never met before. And there were some people who didn&rsquo;t know about it and came last minute who</p><p>I would like fit in perfectly there. I&rsquo;d mentioned the talks, there were workshops, there were</p><p>people, there was great food and drink that Helen took great pains to source from interesting local</p><p>restaurants in the Portland community. And there was a chance to explore Portland. They took great</p><p>care to not only have, you know, talks and presentations during the day, but provide events</p><p>over the couple days before and the day after and evening events where we could all kind of unwind</p><p>and hang out in slightly different spaces that give you a chance to see the local environments.</p><p>And, you know, hang out in a fun place that was a little different. So you&rsquo;re constantly getting to</p><p>see a little bit, things that are a little bit new, explore Portland with, you know, people who may</p><p>not know it either, and talk tech, but in interesting ways.</p><p>What was one of the highlights of the city of Portland for you?</p><p>The highlight, in an interesting way, they went out of their way to create a geocaching style</p><p>scavenger hunt event, which they put a tremendous amount of effort into, and I think was very clever</p><p>and not everybody was into it. I like a little game like this in a competition so that you ended up</p><p>divided into teams and you had to run all over Portland to pick up these clues, which they were</p><p>magnets hidden to whatever magnetic thing they could find in various landmarks all over the city.</p><p>Now, it turns out our team, not so good at the clues, but incredibly persistent. So we probably</p><p>went about three times the mileage that you were supposed to do.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>And we were actually conventioning and complaining a great deal, but it was a great bonding</p><p>experience. It was actually, it was, I knew none of the people on my team super well. And by the</p><p>time we came out of this, what probably should have been a much shorter event than we made it, we</p><p>had bonded tremendously over this whole chance to run around Portland, look for these clues, decode</p><p>these puzzles. And again, not everybody was into it. And we certainly lost a few people along the</p><p>way, but got a certain sense of satisfaction out of finishing with this group. And I learned about</p><p>the bridges in Portland, which are maybe the nice ones, and which is that apparently there&rsquo;s</p><p>different colleges in there. So I thought that was a fun way to integrate the city into the</p><p>convention. And also they had scheduled, for example, a dinner the first night at Autodesk that</p><p>is near to where Tear Down was. And the convention itself took place in the Lloyd Center, which is a</p><p>semi-abandoned mall. And that in and of itself became kind of a character in the convention,</p><p>because it is semi-abandoned, but in this weird, wonderful way that there are a few, there&rsquo;s an</p><p>Annie&rsquo;s Pretzels and there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s probably a Cinnabon somewhere. And those typical mall</p><p>staples, and then a lot of empty storefronts that locals, that you can rent for cheap. So locals</p><p>have taken it over and there&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;ve converted one retail store into a roller skating</p><p>rink. You like look inside the storefront, there are people roller skating in circles, and there&rsquo;s</p><p>still an ice skating rink downstairs. So it&rsquo;s this kind of interesting, wonderful fantasy location</p><p>that you could, you&rsquo;re in a mall, and I grew up in the 80s in malls. So maybe that&rsquo;s personally</p><p>resonant with me. For me in particular, it was a lot of fun because I, it was in a converted GAP</p><p>store. And I had recently made a batch of denim jackets as my most recent project of illuminated</p><p>LED denim jackets. So they were perfect as an installation in a GAP store. And I got to display</p><p>those too. And I got to use the GAP theme in my, instead of GAP kids, it was GAP LEDs.</p><p>Oh, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p><p>It was fantastic and not my idea. I have to give Allie, my friend Allie, who was there, all the props</p><p>for coming up with that idea. And she said it and I said, wait, that&rsquo;s perfect. And she helped me</p><p>style my display and made it fun. It let your imagination run wild a little bit. It was a</p><p>character. It was a presence in and of itself to be in this mall at this convention.</p><p>That&rsquo;s very cool.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Speaking of the mall, what were some of your favorite installations at Teardown?</p><p>Well, of course, I&rsquo;m partial to the LED installations. And Ben Henke, with the help of</p><p>Claire Cassidy, put together a wonderful Pixel Blaze demonstration with all the wonderful things</p><p>you can do with Pixel Blaze LED controller. Jason Coon, you know, who&rsquo;s a good friend of mine, a</p><p>good maker friend, brought a number of his Fibonacci boards and put together. And it was nice</p><p>because you get, you got a reserved space in the GAP store. So his went up across a wall and that</p><p>was the LED lounge area. So they were, they had put beanbags and a sofa beneath it. So you could</p><p>lounge surrounded by beautiful LED art installations. And then I got to meet and talk to</p><p>somebody who had only briefly really talked to before, Aisha, and I cannot pronounce her last</p><p>name, who does wonderful LED PCBs and gave a really great talk there. Oh, and a friend of mine,</p><p>Charlyn Gonda, who is, goes by Charlyn online, had brought her LED jewelry, a subset, but it&rsquo;s</p><p>still wonderful and amazing to look at. So that&rsquo;s the LED overview. And it was all wonderful. But</p><p>there were also other fun things like somebody brought an electron microscope, which I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>have a chance to check out, which I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t, but showed people how to use it. Somebody</p><p>was showing, I guess it&rsquo;s not as much an installation, but it was, it wasn&rsquo;t a workshop.</p><p>They had a wire bonding machine and I had never seen, you know, people wire bonding, you know,</p><p>dies on, you know, tiny, tiny PCBs before. And that was fun to watch. So I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s much</p><p>more and I&rsquo;m, I may pop up with something in the middle of this interview, but, but it was</p><p>actually really fun the way you were kind of lounging amongst all the installations. And yeah,</p><p>I was certainly drawn to and appreciative of all the LED art that was there.</p><p>We were chatting before we started recording about the vibe of the convention.</p><p>What were some of the other things that, that fed that vibe?</p><p>I give all the props in the world to Helen Leigh, who really poured herself, heart, mind, and soul</p><p>into organizing it. And Josh Lifton, who I think runs CrowdSupply for letting her run with it. And</p><p>also obviously doing a lot to make it work as well. But from the beginning, Helen, you know,</p><p>she worked, clearly worked very hard on it and reached out quite early to people to say, you</p><p>know, we&rsquo;re looking to create this inclusive, diverse, interesting, welcoming environment.</p><p>And you do have something to contribute. So she set a tone and an expectation early.</p><p>She ambitiously, you know, took on a venue that didn&rsquo;t come with wifi or anything built in,</p><p>but obviously spent a lot of time thinking about what could work and did a very good job of it.</p><p>Because Teardown last year was at Portland State University. So this was a new venue for them.</p><p>First of all, the first step was the expectation setting that this is a place for everybody.</p><p>Like, you know, do you know anybody who maybe hasn&rsquo;t spoken before who&rsquo;d like to,</p><p>do you know somebody who has, who doesn&rsquo;t get recognition for what they do, who should,</p><p>you know, be displaying here. And so it was clear from the beginning that this was going to be a</p><p>welcoming environment, whether or not you&rsquo;re a big name or, you know, very casual hobbyist with an</p><p>interest. And that was really nice. And it was designed with conversation and connection in mind</p><p>very clearly from the layout of the spaces by building in lounge areas where people could sit</p><p>and talk to building in gaps in the schedule that were really, for me, who, you know,</p><p>I get a little overwhelmed being in large crowds of people for a long time.</p><p>I could either talk to people or I could kind of just duck out and have like a few moments</p><p>to myself without feeling like I was missing too much. I appreciated that on both fronts.</p><p>The time, the space, the planning of events, of social events afterwards that, like, you know,</p><p>I mentioned, you know, going to Autodesk for a big party for planning this, you know, these team</p><p>geocaching hunt all over Portland for planning a meeting at a video game bar that made it very</p><p>easy to engage with others and like, you know, something of interest to kind of everybody. And</p><p>for me, you know, there&rsquo;s some people who just want to go and talk nothing but tech,</p><p>which is great too. You could certainly do that, but it gave you other interesting things to look</p><p>at and comment on too. So it put it all in kind of the context of you&rsquo;re in this city that is a</p><p>great place to be. And let&rsquo;s all bring all these projects and topics that we love together here,</p><p>but let&rsquo;s also interact with, you know, the community around us, or at least, you know,</p><p>find out what&rsquo;s interesting in the community around us while we&rsquo;re here. So it&rsquo;s engagement.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of engagement, a lot of planning. It was nicely planned and nicely announced. So</p><p>you knew what was going to happen at any moment. There was no trying to figure things out. A lot</p><p>of space was provided. I think what also contributed to the vibe was it was a conscious decision</p><p>at Teardown, for example, not to have badge hacking, because while it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a</p><p>wonderful and exciting event, I&rsquo;m not sure why they did this. This is my take on why not having</p><p>badge hacking was actually a positive in this circumstance is it can introduce a level of kind</p><p>of competition and one-upsmanship that was absent. And it also can drive people to kind of work</p><p>solo, which again, they produce amazing things. And at the end, it&rsquo;s very cool,</p><p>but really the events were designed for communication and connection. So I think</p><p>that was purposely omitted from the roster. So yeah, a lot of factors were just kind of</p><p>well thought out. And I think to also went to great lengths just to make people feel included,</p><p>as I mentioned to you, I think before the show, you know, a great icebreaker. You know,</p><p>when I go to a convention like this, I always feel like I&rsquo;ve found my people because you always have</p><p>something in common to talk about. And my big icebreaker question is if I don&rsquo;t know what else</p><p>to say, so what are you interested in? What do you like to do? Because people always have a good</p><p>answer to that. One of the people I asked said, you know, I&rsquo;ve just been interested in learning</p><p>about programmable electronics. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, but I was told to come by</p><p>and, you know, learn about them here. And so complete newbie, but he had a great time.</p><p>He was, and people were really happy to talk to him. You know, every maker I&rsquo;ve ever met is super</p><p>happy to talk about what they&rsquo;re doing and show it off. So it was, you know, he had a great time</p><p>listening to people and people were happy to encourage him and to give him tips to, you know,</p><p>where he might go to pursue his interests. So it just felt like it was kind of an equalizer</p><p>because there were also some people, there were people with pretty big YouTube followings who,</p><p>you had maybe a parasocial relationship with them, but it was, you know, but you got a chance to just</p><p>kind of talk to them and they&rsquo;re normal people too, just as much as the guy who&rsquo;d never done</p><p>a single electronics project, you know, by himself. And yeah, you just had this feeling</p><p>that kind of everybody was in the same space, sharing the same experiences.</p><p>That is awesome to hear. What a great conference.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, it really was wonderful. Really had a great time. And it didn&rsquo;t hurt that</p><p>some of my favorite makers who I do know and adore were there and we just brought the party,</p><p>but it was a party that everybody was really happy to engage in. So, you know, it was great.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ll link to some of those makers in the show notes as well.</p><p>Debra, thanks so much for being on the show.</p><p>Oh, Paul, it&rsquo;s my pleasure. Thanks for having me.</p><p>Thanks to Debra for that interview. Teardown sounded like a really good time.</p><p>Yeah, I was bummed I wasn&rsquo;t able to go to this year.</p><p>It sounds just like a great group of makers there between Charlyn and Jason Coon and Ben</p><p>Henke, I think was there, she said. Yeah, all the cool folks.</p><p>Yeah, all the folks that I would want to actually meet someday. So I might have to put this one on</p><p>my bucket list as well. Yep.</p><p>What&rsquo;s your first one for us this episode?</p><p>All right. So you know me, I&rsquo;m all about the DIY synth stuff.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of synth libraries for microcontrollers. Some of my favorites are the</p><p>Mozzie for Arduino synth library and CircuitPython&rsquo;s Synth.io. But I&rsquo;ve also used the Teensy Audio</p><p>Library, which is sort of the standard bearer for a lot of the good audio projects out there.</p><p>And there&rsquo;s also Daisy, the Daisy Seed, which is like used in professional products.</p><p>And there&rsquo;s others. But all of them have the problem of, you know, how do I get things wired</p><p>up to make sound? Because they&rsquo;re a library. They&rsquo;re not a physical thing. And then once you</p><p>have something that actually makes sound, it still requires a good amount of programming</p><p>and synthesis knowledge to make something that sounds cool.</p><p>Well, there&rsquo;s this project that&rsquo;s been around for a while called the Tulip Creative Computer,</p><p>and it tries to solve some of these problems. And it solves a bunch of other problems too.</p><p>But the main one is like, how do you make music? I&rsquo;ve been following it for a while,</p><p>and lately it&rsquo;s gotten really interesting. It&rsquo;s a ESP32 based device you can buy right now for</p><p>60 bucks. It includes a seven inch touchscreen, high quality audio deck, MIDI I/O, a battery,</p><p>and yeah, ESP32 processor on it. It runs a custom version of MicroPython,</p><p>and it&rsquo;s set up so you can plug in a USB keyboard and just start typing into it directly. You don&rsquo;t</p><p>have to have a computer to program it. You can program it by itself. And because you&rsquo;re, you</p><p>start out with just the REPL, the MicroPython REPL, it&rsquo;s sort of a live coding music environment.</p><p>If you want it to be like the Sonic Pi project, which is really fun by the way, if you have a</p><p>Raspberry Pi and want to make music kind of live coding, I highly recommend trying out Sonic Pi.</p><p>But unlike the Sonic Pi, there&rsquo;s no hassle of getting a Raspberry Pi running.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s a microcontroller, it just starts up instantly. It&rsquo;s just kind of cool. But wait,</p><p>there&rsquo;s more. Did I say it&rsquo;s a device? It&rsquo;s actually a fully open source project,</p><p>and you can build one yourself if you&rsquo;ve got an ESP32 S3 board and a touchscreen.</p><p>And the Tulip designers provide a bunch of guides depending on what specific hardware you have.</p><p>So you can like kind of cobble together from parts you might already have in your</p><p>shoebox full of electronics to make your own little Tulip thing. There&rsquo;s also a</p><p>desktop Tulip emulator if you want to try it out just like on any computer that runs Python.</p><p>And to get back to the synth libraries, on the physical microcontroller side,</p><p>Tulip uses the Amy synth library, AMY, which is the C library that has bindings in both Arduino</p><p>and Python. And it&rsquo;s a really interesting take on a synth library in that it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>try to be super low level. It mostly tries to say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bunch of synthesizer recreations</p><p>with patches you can just load up.&rdquo; So you don&rsquo;t have to like hook things together like a modular</p><p>synth the way you have to do in Mozzie or Synth.io. You just like say, &ldquo;Load up this DX7 sound,&rdquo; and</p><p>you get to play electric piano or whatever. And it&rsquo;s got drum machines and a bunch of other things.</p><p>You can go low level if you want, but by default, you don&rsquo;t have to. So I have a Tulip coming.</p><p>Should be here maybe next week. And I&rsquo;ll include links to all this in the show notes.</p><p>I watched the video that we&rsquo;ll link to, and you didn&rsquo;t even touch on one of the cooler parts. So</p><p>you start off at the REPL, but then you just hit an icon in the lower right-hand side of the screen,</p><p>and you can choose from different modes. You can put it into synthesizer mode or drum sequencer</p><p>mode. So to your point, you don&rsquo;t need to know the libraries and the coding to actually make</p><p>that happen. If you do, you get that level of control, but they also have a UI for all of that,</p><p>which I thought was really interesting. Yeah, and the way that it&rsquo;s set up is that</p><p>you can have all these functions, the drum machine function, the synthesizer functions,</p><p>kind of all running in the background, and you can still have the REPL controlling it.</p><p>Like you essentially controlling it via MIDI, or MIDI as in quotes. If this was a video,</p><p>you&rsquo;d see my fingers going wiggle wiggle. It&rsquo;s really interesting because in Arduino and</p><p>CircuitPython, to rewire the synthesizer, you essentially stop the synthesizer, rewire it,</p><p>start it back up again. But in the Tulip case, while it&rsquo;s running, you&rsquo;re kind of unplugging</p><p>it in real time and reloading things and changing it and stuff. And so it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t wait to play with it. Yeah, for 60 bucks, how can you go wrong?</p><p>Totally right. That was my number one. So Paul, what&rsquo;s your number one this week?</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to go back to the well on code editors. I didn&rsquo;t know that I had a thing for testing code</p><p>editors, but apparently I do. After previously talking about JetBrains fleet way back in</p><p>episode three and recently covering the CircuitPython online IDE by River Wang, I have two</p><p>more to share. First up is ViperIDE, an online IDE for MicroPython and CircuitPython, made by</p><p>Volodymyr Shymanskyy, I hope I pronounced that right. I apologize if I didn&rsquo;t, who is the co-founder</p><p>of BlinkIO, an IoT cloud platform. Like other browser-based solutions, ViperIDE requires Chrome</p><p>or Edge because it requires web serial to work, which isn&rsquo;t available in Firefox or Safari.</p><p>One of the really innovative things about it is that you can connect your boards via USB like you</p><p>would expect, but there&rsquo;s also support for web REPL over the internet or local network, Bluetooth,</p><p>and P2P WebRTC support. It includes features you would expect in an IDE, including syntax</p><p>highlighting for Python, JSON, TOML, and more, and it has a viewer for markdown files and can</p><p>auto expand and minify JSON files just like a big IDE would. You can also install it as a</p><p>progressive web app so it looks and feels like an app, not just a browser or browser tab. And it</p><p>includes a terminal, and I&rsquo;m putting quotes around that. What you really see is the REPL, the serial</p><p>console. Unlike any of the web editors who do have a serial printout, this includes that, but the</p><p>terminal also allows you to interact with the REPL, which is really cool, and I haven&rsquo;t seen it in</p><p>another online IDE. It&rsquo;s definitely MicroPython-focused. For example, there&rsquo;s buttons for</p><p>soft reset and hard reset, which is handy, but the hard reset button doesn&rsquo;t work in CircuitPython</p><p>as it calls the machine function used in MicroPython to reset it. It also includes support</p><p>for MicroPython&rsquo;s package manager right in the IDE, making it simple to import libraries.</p><p>It&rsquo;s running MicroPython compiled to WebAssembly right in your browser, and you can even try it</p><p>with an emulator in your browser as well. It&rsquo;s really well done. I&rsquo;ve included links to a review</p><p>from Les Pounder at Tom&rsquo;s Hardware and Mr. Shymanskyy&rsquo;s recent visit to the PyCast show as well.</p><p>Next up is another editor called Zed. Zed&rsquo;s been around for a little less than a year for macOS</p><p>and just recently released a Linux version, which is how it caught my eye. This is an editor in IDE</p><p>for folks who miss Atom or Sublime Text and don&rsquo;t need all the features of a full-blown IDE,</p><p>like features found in VS Code or PyCharm, like a profiler, for example.</p><p>Zed is from the creators of Atom, and it&rsquo;s also open source. Right from their home page,</p><p>here&rsquo;s how they describe Zed. Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor,</p><p>and unrelenting performance keeps you in the flow and makes other tools feel slow.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll note I said &ldquo;multiplayer&rdquo; in the description. It includes the ability for</p><p>multiple developers to collaborate and edit code together within a shared workspace,</p><p>which is similar to JetBrains Spaces. If you&rsquo;re collaborating with someone, it has the ability</p><p>to jump to your teammate&rsquo;s location right in the code and vice versa, and has a built-in screen</p><p>sharing tool. There&rsquo;s a few things it doesn&rsquo;t have, such as Git integration, but if you&rsquo;re</p><p>comfortable at the command line, that&rsquo;s really not a big deal. It also doesn&rsquo;t automatically pick up</p><p>Python virtual environments. You have to edit a JSON configuration by hand and point to the</p><p>location of your virtual environment. And then one other thing that I did discover that was</p><p>interesting is that it uses pyright as a linter right out of the box. pyright is a static type</p><p>checker for Python, and I opened my big web app with built-in fast API and had all these squiggly</p><p>lines with pyright telling me that all my code was wrong, and I did a double-take. I&rsquo;m like,</p><p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s telling me my code&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; so I was digging into what pyright is.</p><p>But if you&rsquo;re an intermediate to advanced user and you&rsquo;re okay at the command line and just want a</p><p>fast code editor, check out ZADD. I&rsquo;m giving it a chance as my daily driver, and so far I&rsquo;m really</p><p>liking it. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been running it for a couple weeks now, using it to edit CircuitPython and</p><p>Markdown files. And yeah, it&rsquo;s fast and pretty easy to set up. It kind of reminds me of Sublime</p><p>Text, but like Sublime Text from five years ago or whatever, when it was simpler. It&rsquo;s definitely</p><p>a lot simpler and faster than VS Code, which has become a bit ungainly to me. There&rsquo;s just too many</p><p>extensions now, and it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s too much choice. The paradox of choice for like, &ldquo;What</p><p>should I do? How should I set this up?&rdquo; Whereas Zed&rsquo;s a bit cleaner. It comes with a lot of</p><p>code syntax highlighting and code linting built in without you having to set up anything. And I only</p><p>had to do a couple of little tiny configuration changes to make it so that I could use the</p><p>CircuitPython stubs with it. So yeah, it looks pretty good. Yep, it&rsquo;s written in Rust, which I</p><p>think really contributes to the speed. I probably should have mentioned that as well. Nice. What&rsquo;s</p><p>your next one? If you&rsquo;ve been reading the Hackaday blog recently, you might have seen this article.</p><p>I was very happy to see that my friend Leah Buechley was mentioned on Hackaday recently.</p><p>She&rsquo;s a professor at the University of New Mexico, and for the last few years has been applying C&amp;C</p><p>and advanced mathematical techniques to ceramics and clay, creating shapes and overhangs and angles</p><p>and structures that I wouldn&rsquo;t think possible in clay, let alone 3D printer plastic.</p><p>They&rsquo;re using these commercially available 3D clay printers, which I didn&rsquo;t know existed,</p><p>but they&rsquo;ve augmented them with special tricks, sometimes with special algorithms to feed</p><p>the slicer, sometimes with special formulations of clay. And if Leah Buechley&rsquo;s name is familiar,</p><p>it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s also the creator of the LilyPad Arduino sewable electronic system</p><p>from about 15 years ago, and the echoes of which, the round PCB with big pads,</p><p>you can see in the Circuit Playground Express boards that are very popular at Adafruit.</p><p>So the recent thing that she came out with, her and her team, is called Cerametal. It&rsquo;s a way of</p><p>3D printing metal on the desktop using a custom metalized clay. And once it&rsquo;s printed, it&rsquo;s fired</p><p>in a kiln, and it gets centered into a solid metal part. So you just have like a standard,</p><p>like tiny 3D printer, you print out this clay onto a platform, and then you put that into the kiln,</p><p>and it becomes a metal object. Like, what? So this custom metal clay is just made from metal powder,</p><p>xanthan gum, and a few other ingredients, and you just mix it together in a literal, like,</p><p>kitchen stand mixer. To slice the model that they want to print out, they couldn&rsquo;t use a standard</p><p>slicer like Cura, because the clay, once you start extruding it, you can&rsquo;t stop. It just kind of</p><p>keeps coming out because of the way that the mechanical materials of the clay works. So they</p><p>had to create a new slicer that supports this continuous extrusion. And so it&rsquo;s sort of like</p><p>vase mode. If you&rsquo;ve ever done vase mode in 3D printing, it&rsquo;s sort of like that, but it will do</p><p>fills because they want to, like, make a filled object. And the print resolution is pretty</p><p>impressive. They can do a 0.6 millimeter nozzle and 0.3 millimeter layer height, which is pretty</p><p>comparable to a standard 3D printer. The cost is around 2k. That&rsquo;s for, like, basically half of</p><p>that is for the printer, half of that is for a kiln. And when you compare that to, like, the 50k</p><p>to 130k for an SLS, Selective Laser Sentry Machine, that&rsquo;s pretty darn cheap. And you&rsquo;re doing this</p><p>all on your desk, you know? A desk, and then you take it to a kiln. And, but one of the more</p><p>interesting things to me, like, so I&rsquo;ll never do this because, you know, I don&rsquo;t play with clay,</p><p>but I think it&rsquo;s really fascinating that you can make metal objects now. In their slicer,</p><p>they use an algorithm called Fermat Spirals to fill in the spaces, because one of the</p><p>characteristics of the Fermat Spiral is that it guarantees that the area between the lines</p><p>are equal area, which is perfect for when you&rsquo;re laying out a base that should be filled. I&rsquo;ll</p><p>include a couple of links in the show notes for some things to play with. Fermat Spirals are also</p><p>very pretty. They&rsquo;re sort of a parabolic spiral. There&rsquo;s also a great video that Leah gave for the</p><p>ACM SIGCHI conference that goes through all of this. And so I highly recommend watching the</p><p>video. It&rsquo;s about maybe 14 minutes long. I read the Hackaday article, and I thought it did a good</p><p>job of explaining, you know, how you put the powder together with the clay and then fire it in the</p><p>kiln. But one of the things that caught my eye is they said that the shrinkage is consistent,</p><p>which has got to be awesome for metal parts, because then you&rsquo;re getting, you know, the same</p><p>part every time. Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the, that&rsquo;s, my wife does a bunch of clay stuff, and that&rsquo;s</p><p>one of the things that you&rsquo;re always having to figure out is clay always shrinks when you fire</p><p>it. But the amount of shrinkage really is based on the thickness of your piece, the tallness of the</p><p>piece, the amount of like wetness that day of the piece. And so like, you essentially have to like</p><p>make a couple of trial runs to get something of a consistent dimension. And so the fact that they can</p><p>get a very consistent output is huge. Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting. I had no idea. So yeah, what&rsquo;s your</p><p>number two for this week? Way back in episode four, in November of 2022, we talked about Matter,</p><p>the open source IoT specification that&rsquo;s managed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, which is a</p><p>mouthful. If you don&rsquo;t remember, don&rsquo;t know of Matter, it requires a Matter controller, such as</p><p>a Google Nest device, Apple HomePod or Apple TV, or most Amazon Echo devices. And then for example,</p><p>you can buy a Matter supported smart light bulb and set it up with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant</p><p>or Alexa without having to worry about what it&rsquo;s compatible with. If it&rsquo;s Matter compatible,</p><p>it&rsquo;ll work with them all. I&rsquo;ll link to a great article from Wired Magazine on what is Matter.</p><p>The reason I bring it up is Scott Shawcroft, CircuitPython&rsquo;s lead developer, shared in a</p><p>recent Python on hardware newsletter update that he&rsquo;s working on an open source implementation of</p><p>Matter called CircuitMatter. Don&rsquo;t let the name fool you. It will be a pure Python implementation</p><p>of the Matter specification that will also be compatible with CircuitPython and potentially</p><p>even MicroPython. Jeff Epler has already implemented IPv6 networking support in CircuitPython,</p><p>which Matter needs as well. This leads me to believe, and this is just a guess,</p><p>is that Adafruit might make a Matter compatible microcontroller at some point in the future.</p><p>There&rsquo;s already a board from SparkFun that is Matter compatible, but only with Arduino,</p><p>not with CircuitPython. I&rsquo;ll link to that in the show notes as that came out this past January.</p><p>Now, if you read the article from Wired on Matter that I mentioned earlier, it does mention that</p><p>the functionality supported by Matter is mostly pretty basic for now, limited to on/off, start/stop,</p><p>and notifications from the device. But if you could program a microcontroller to even just do</p><p>a start/stop instead of always sending data via MQTT, for example, to take a measurement,</p><p>I could see a number of different use cases that pop into my mind for that.</p><p>It&rsquo;s very, very early in development, but I think it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m excited to keep an eye on.</p><p>Yeah, the Matter stuff is really interesting. With the recent talk of Swift Embedded,</p><p>Swift&rsquo;s the programming language that Apple uses for all their devices, what we should be using</p><p>when we write apps for the iPhone or whatever, they recently released a bunch of Matter examples</p><p>that run on the ESP32-C6 dev board, which I think there&rsquo;s an ESP32-C6 Adafruit product as well.</p><p>These are just another version of the ESP32, it&rsquo;s not like a special chip,</p><p>it&rsquo;s not super expensive, it&rsquo;s meant to be really low cost to go into smart light bulbs</p><p>and things like that. I can&rsquo;t wait to see more hobbyist-level things that use Matter.</p><p>Yep, exactly. And it&rsquo;ll probably have to be an S3 board because it needs</p><p>Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so that S3 is probably the base minimum.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s our show. I mentioned the special announcements. You want to tune in for a</p><p>special live episode of The Bootloader on CircuitPython Day, coming up on Friday, August 16th.</p><p>Thanks to Debra Ansell for taking time to share her experience at Teardown 2024,</p><p>and thank you for listening.
