<time datetime=2024-09-02 class=text-muted>Monday, September 02, 2024</time></div><header class=article-meta></header><p>Welcome to The Bootloader. I&rsquo;m Paul Cutler.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m Tod Kurt. If you want to learn more about this podcast, visit thebootloader.net</p><p>for show notes and transcripts, and where you can also find our new newsletter.</p><p>Paul, two weeks ago on 16th of August was CircuitPython Day. We were honored to be an</p><p>official part of it with a special live video version of our podcast. You can check that</p><p>out on YouTube, and we provide a link in the show notes. I just thought we&rsquo;d like maybe</p><p>talk a little bit about the experience of the entire CircuitPython Day in our live show.</p><p>But first, I&rsquo;d like to say thank you so much for organizing all of that.</p><p>Oh, it was nothing.</p><p>Like not all of CircuitPython Day, but like for our part of it was all organized by you.</p><p>I just kind of showed up. So thank you so much.</p><p>It was my pleasure.</p><p>The format was we first talked about what CircuitPython had been doing for the last</p><p>year in terms of like its features and updates and how it&rsquo;s in its relationship to MicroPython.</p><p>We each talked about one project that each of us had done. It was really nice to hear</p><p>your Song Matrix thing because it straddled so many different technologies because it</p><p>was a network project that dealt with MQTT and the Shazam API. I don&rsquo;t do much internet</p><p>stuff with my little electronic devices that run CircuitPython. So it was really cool to</p><p>see all that and to see like real Python working in concert with CircuitPython.</p><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s one of the really neat things about the project. I&rsquo;ve got a couple of projects</p><p>that do that, but actually writing real Python on a Raspberry Pi and then writing CircuitPython</p><p>and having those talk to each other is just, that&rsquo;s what excites me about CircuitPython</p><p>is that those physical devices that you can touch and feel. It&rsquo;s just something better</p><p>than just seeing code on a screen.</p><p>Totally. And it kind of reminds me of the synergy that a lot of web developers got when</p><p>we were able to write JavaScript code that ran in the browser and also JavaScript code</p><p>that ran on the backend using Node or something. So it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re getting that same level</p><p>of like, &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t have to switch gears too much because I&rsquo;m still writing Python.&rdquo;</p><p>Just different flavors of it.</p><p>And then my project, I made this like two weeks before CircuitPython Day, I made this</p><p>like plan that I&rsquo;m going to design and build and code a little playing card sized drum</p><p>machine and it didn&rsquo;t quite turn out because I made some tiny mistakes. So I&rsquo;ve got 10</p><p>of these boards and I&rsquo;m wondering, should I even like fix them up and put them in the</p><p>store? But it was a fun experiment. I tried doing a similar thing a couple of years previous</p><p>with CircuitPython Day and that worked out pretty well. So this was a good learning experience</p><p>for me. And if anybody has seen this little drum machine playing card thing that I made,</p><p>if anyone is interested in one, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can send you one.</p><p>And I think it&rsquo;s cool that the project didn&rsquo;t actually work out and you talked about it.</p><p>So many projects are, &ldquo;Look, I did this and it just all worked,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not how it</p><p>is in real life, right? We all have challenges and things break and it&rsquo;s good to actually</p><p>show that side of a project.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>Well, what&rsquo;s your first one this episode for us?</p><p>All right. Synthesizers. Have you heard of them? So one of the things that I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>into is modular synthesis. So it&rsquo;s the kind of mad scientist synthesizers you might see</p><p>with all the knobs and lights and all the cables that plug in. And the way this all</p><p>works is that each little module does one specific part of the whole synthesis process.</p><p>And so you have something that might make a noise and then you have something else that</p><p>shapes that noise&rsquo;s loudness and another module that shapes that noise&rsquo;s frequency response,</p><p>sort of a tone control. And then things that will produce different pitches that control</p><p>the thing that makes noise. And so it can get really expensive really fast. And so people</p><p>when I&rsquo;ve talked about modular synthesis, they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, that sounds really cool.</p><p>I want to get into it.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s really expensive to get into if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>building the stuff yourself or if you&rsquo;ve just decided to sort of like, &ldquo;This is my hobby</p><p>and I&rsquo;m going to sink a couple hundred dollars into it every couple of months.&rdquo;</p><p>And so if you wanted something else that was modular synthesis but was not as expensive,</p><p>what were your options? It&rsquo;s like, well, there are some of these software programs out there</p><p>like VCV Rack that will do the sort of virtual on your screen modular synth. And that&rsquo;s actually</p><p>a really cool way to get started. But it&rsquo;s a thing on a screen. And one of the whole</p><p>points of modular synthesizers and physical synthesizers and physical things in general</p><p>is to get yourself away from screens. And there&rsquo;s also the other problem of if you&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to build some of this stuff yourself, the things that you will be interacting with,</p><p>like the jacks you plug cables into and the knobs you turn, those don&rsquo;t work well on a</p><p>breadboard. There&rsquo;s always problems where you&rsquo;re like, as you&rsquo;re turning the knob, the</p><p>potentiometer will come out of the breadboard because they&rsquo;re just really not made to be</p><p>plugged in like that. And so what&rsquo;s the solution? And I&rsquo;ve been seeing some noise about this</p><p>thing called MICRORACK from this synth get-together, the synth conference called Super Booth a</p><p>few months ago in Germany. And lately I&rsquo;ve been inundated by Instagram ads for its Kickstarter</p><p>campaign, which I&rsquo;m like, man, Instagram has me targeted. And so MICRORACK is a collection</p><p>of little PCB modules that plug into a breadboard, just like all these other things we might</p><p>have that like Adafruit sells, except they are modular synthesis modules. So instead</p><p>of being several hundred dollars for each little module, it&rsquo;s a little like each little</p><p>module does the same functionality as these synth modules, but they just plug in and you</p><p>wire them together, little jumper wires like you do on a breadboard. And so it&rsquo;s really</p><p>nice. It&rsquo;s inexpensive. The way you interact with it is very much the way you interact</p><p>with stuff on breadboards. So if you&rsquo;re used to doing stuff on breadboards, this is like,</p><p>oh, this will fit right in. And they&rsquo;ve got a pretty rich set of modules, it looks like.</p><p>And they&rsquo;re using the Solaris breadboard mostly as a power distribution and a mounting platform,</p><p>which is great. It&rsquo;s like, oh, here&rsquo;s this very common plastic thing with lots of holes.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s use it as a mounting board, essentially. I&rsquo;ve become a backer of it. I&rsquo;m going to hopefully</p><p>it&rsquo;ll be out. They&rsquo;ve been making modules for like six months or a year, and they&rsquo;ve</p><p>been showing them off for several months now. And so I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s a real thing. It looks</p><p>pretty real. And if anything, it&rsquo;s going to be a nice way of solving some of these problems</p><p>of how do I get the knobs to not move around when I&rsquo;m prototyping something? Because I</p><p>prototype my own little synthesizers on breadboards, and their modules, like some of their modules</p><p>are just like little knobs that have outputs. I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s perfect.</p><p>Like you were saying at the beginning, I looked into EuroRack a couple of years ago when I</p><p>had some interest, and it was just so overwhelming. I had no idea where to start. And like you</p><p>mentioned, the cost quickly went up and up. And I thought about just buying a couple of</p><p>modules from just Winterbloom and starting there, but I still found it pretty overwhelming.</p><p>But this is something I might check out. Do you remember how much it was roughly on Kickstarter?</p><p>I think for like, they&rsquo;ve got like a starter kit that&rsquo;s around like 80 bucks or whatever</p><p>that contains like a good handful of modules. I think the most expensive thing you can get,</p><p>which contains all their possible modules is like 300 or 400, which is the cost of one</p><p>modular synth module if you go to a store that sells them. So in terms of I think modules</p><p>per dollar, it&rsquo;s one of the highest that&rsquo;s out there. I&rsquo;m mostly interested in it since</p><p>I developed some of my own little music gizmos. I&rsquo;m mostly interested in using it as little</p><p>pieces of potential UI that I will have in my synthesizer. I&rsquo;ll just like use their knobs,</p><p>use their jacks, that kind of stuff. There have been other similar, let&rsquo;s make some of</p><p>this audio stuff more breadboard friendly little things that have been out there. I&rsquo;ll</p><p>put some links to some previous ones in the show notes. One of those famous ones is called</p><p>Breadboard Friends by Mutable Instruments, Emily Gillette. It&rsquo;s like two of the main</p><p>problems with the synth stuff on when you&rsquo;re prototyping some stuff is how do you do jacks</p><p>and knobs? The other one is how do you do power? Because the Eurorack standard is all</p><p>the signals are plus minus 10 volts. And your breadboard, like everything you do on a breadboard</p><p>is usually like three volts or five volts. So it&rsquo;s like one of the main things it solves</p><p>is how do you make that work?</p><p>Very cool. So how about you? What&rsquo;s your number one today?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about building a standup arcade for probably 20 years from when I first</p><p>got a set of ROMs, the actual arcade games you load into an emulator to play. About five</p><p>or six years ago, I finally started it. And living here in the Twin Cities, we have a</p><p>local company called Paradise Arcade, who has a focus on the community around fighting</p><p>sticks, fight stick controllers for fighting games. But they have a wide selection of arcade</p><p>parts, including buttons, joysticks, and the hardware to hook them all up to a computer.</p><p>I drove down to their shop, which is more of a warehouse and not a retail shop, which</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know at the time. But they were pretty awesome and helped me out. From there, I bought</p><p>plans on the internet to actually build the cabinets and then bought the MDF to do it.</p><p>But I&rsquo;ve never done woodworking. So this has all been in fits and starts over the last</p><p>couple of years. I haven&rsquo;t worked on it in a year or two, though I plan to pick it up</p><p>again in the next few weeks as I have that itch again.</p><p>The point of the story is, if I had to do it all over again, there&rsquo;s a solution that</p><p>looks to be a lot easier. Pimoroni is taking pre-orders for the PiCade Max, a bar top arcade,</p><p>not a stand up, that sits on top of a desk or a bar, hence the name. It includes everything</p><p>you need to build it, just add a Raspberry Pi 5. The kit includes 6mm powder coated MDF,</p><p>two player controls, and a 19 inch screen and 5/4 aspect ratio, just like original arcade</p><p>monitors.</p><p>What&rsquo;s really innovative about the PiCade Max are the add-on boards that come with it.</p><p>There&rsquo;s the PiCade Max Power Hat, which powers both the Pi and the screen at 5V and 12V.</p><p>The PiCade Max USB controller board supports up to 24 buttons and two 4-way joysticks that</p><p>connect via USB-C. This itself is a deal, as the wiring harness I bought for mine was</p><p>about $100 just by itself.</p><p>And then lastly, there&rsquo;s the PiCade Max USB audio board, which has two screw terminals</p><p>for a pair of speakers and is an I2S audio DAC with a 3W amplifier and volume control</p><p>via a separate encoder board. What&rsquo;s really innovative is that these last two boards are</p><p>powered by the RP2040 and connect via USB-C to the Raspberry Pi 5. Pimoroni mentioned</p><p>in an interview with Les Pounder at Tom&rsquo;s Hardware that they&rsquo;ll be selling these two</p><p>standalone boards in the future, and I know I want to check out the audio board for sure.</p><p>The PiCade Max kit retails for £495, or about $650 with the current exchange rate. That&rsquo;s</p><p>really not that much compared to how much it would cost to build it yourself and take</p><p>it from me. And it&rsquo;s about 50% lighter and not nearly as heavy as using normal MDF to</p><p>build the cabinet. Of course, I don&rsquo;t want to know what shipping would cost across the</p><p>pond for that. I&rsquo;ll link to a couple articles from Tom&rsquo;s Hardware with their coverage, as</p><p>well as the PiCast show on YouTube, where host Les Pounder had Paul and Phil from Pimoroni</p><p>on to talk all about it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s really cool. There have been a few retro arcade using a Raspberry Pi things over</p><p>the years, but they&rsquo;ve always been sort of, &ldquo;Oh, if you can find these random parts that</p><p>I happen to have in my garage, if you can find the exact clones, you can use my plans.&rdquo;</p><p>But having something like this PiCade Max could make it really easy just to, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going</p><p>to build it this weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>Yep. And you do need to set aside time. Paul from Pimoroni joked on the stream that they</p><p>did that his speed run of doing a complete installation was like two hours. And that&rsquo;s</p><p>someone who knows what they&rsquo;re doing and has probably done it before. So you need to put</p><p>a good chunk of time to do it. But then again, it&rsquo;s taking me years and years to work on</p><p>mine. So this sounds like it would probably be a lot faster.</p><p>No kidding. Yeah. And I&rsquo;d love to get the link to the place in your area where you actually</p><p>got some real arcade hardware. Because I used to be really into that. I used to have a couple</p><p>of stand-up arcade machines. They were old Atari Vector things that were always dying</p><p>because that was kind of their normal state of things. They were in, once these old games</p><p>get past a certain age, they&rsquo;re kind of always failing, it seems like.</p><p>Yeah. And it&rsquo;s really neat. They have everything from PCBs for a couple of games to mounting</p><p>hardware to they custom make some PCBs. And then they&rsquo;ve got the whole fighting stick</p><p>stuff. But I&rsquo;ll make sure to link to Paradise Arcade in the show notes too, because they</p><p>ship internationally.</p><p>Yeah. And the cool thing about the PiCade Max being separate boards is you can take some</p><p>of the Pimoroni stuff and use it with an existing sort of arcade platform that you&rsquo;ve already</p><p>partially built. If you are kind of stuck on the wiring harness problem of how do you</p><p>get these joysticks and buttons and speakers hooked up to whatever you want.</p><p>And I&rsquo;ve been worried about sound because just doing the 3.5 millimeter out from a Raspberry</p><p>Pi isn&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s still a little tinny. But yeah, I&rsquo;m excited about that because I</p><p>really want to check out the audio board. It&rsquo;s got the two pairs of speaker terminals</p><p>so you can use a real pair of speakers with it, not just some cheap computer speakers.</p><p>Totally. Yeah.</p><p>What&rsquo;s your next one for us?</p><p>So yeah, well, OK. So at the beginning of August, on August 8th, Raspberry Pi introduced</p><p>a new microcontroller board, a successor to their popular RP2040 Pico. It&rsquo;s the Pico 2</p><p>and a new chip that powers the RP2350, which is a great chip. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;ve improved</p><p>it in almost every manner. Like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s got a like a twice as fast dual core set of</p><p>CPUs in it. It&rsquo;s got extra PIO if you&rsquo;re doing that sort of weird protocol stuff. It&rsquo;s got</p><p>twice the memory. Just oh, it&rsquo;s a lower power. You know, even though it&rsquo;s twice as fast,</p><p>it&rsquo;s lower power. So it&rsquo;s just all around a really good update. And I&rsquo;ve been really</p><p>excited as I&rsquo;ve been slowly getting some of these RP2350 based boards in to test. Since</p><p>it&rsquo;s twice as fast and almost all the stuff I do with the chip is in CircuitPython or</p><p>synthesizer stuff, both of which are really compute intensive. Having a chip that&rsquo;s twice</p><p>as fast means I can do essentially twice as much, twice as many synth voices or something</p><p>or twice as fast response time. And as I was testing it out, I learned that the capacitive</p><p>touch library in CircuitPython called TouchIO wasn&rsquo;t working with it. And I looked, started</p><p>looking into it, found a bug on the CircuitPython GitHub. As I was looking at it with my oscilloscope,</p><p>I discovered that there&rsquo;s this errata that was in the data sheet called E9 that is a</p><p>problem with the actual hardware, where if you&rsquo;re using a GPIO pin on this chip in a</p><p>certain way, mostly as an input, it will latch up and stay at 2.2 volts instead of like high</p><p>or low. And so the way the capacitive touch sensing works in CircuitPython and a lot of</p><p>other systems is you have a pin and it drives that pin high for like 10 microseconds. And</p><p>then it turns that GPIO pin into an input and watches how long it takes for that pin</p><p>to go low. And that time that it takes is basically it&rsquo;s discharging the capacitance</p><p>of whatever the line is connected to, like a little capacitive pad. And when you human</p><p>touch that pad, that changes that capacitance. And so the time it takes to go from high to</p><p>low changes. And so with that, you can get a really good sense of like, oh, was something,</p><p>has something touched the capacitive pad or not. But because of this pin is sort of like</p><p>staying high or not staying high, staying at 2.2 volts, which is kind of not quite high,</p><p>but it&rsquo;s definitely not low. It means that touch I/O doesn&rsquo;t work. It also means that</p><p>certain kinds of button inputs won&rsquo;t work either that have like certain low or certain</p><p>high of resistance pulldown resistors, or if you&rsquo;ve configured internal pulldowns in</p><p>the chip. And so I&rsquo;m at this point, I&rsquo;m not recommending people use the Pico 2 or the</p><p>RP 2350 if they&rsquo;re newbies, because it&rsquo;s got this weird input problem where you don&rsquo;t</p><p>know is it not working because of my wiring or is it not working because you&rsquo;re tickling</p><p>this weird input bug on the chip. And thankfully, Dan Halbert has looked at, Dan Halbert, who&rsquo;s</p><p>a core CircuitPython developer, he looked into it in much more detail than I, and he&rsquo;s</p><p>created a bunch of really good test cases that he&rsquo;s opened issues up on the Raspberry</p><p>Pi GitHub and on the MicroPython GitHub. And so there&rsquo;s a bunch of good data and the relevant</p><p>people have been notified. So hopefully there&rsquo;ll be a fix. I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;ll ever be</p><p>a software fix. We might have to wait for the next version of the Pico 2 chip to come</p><p>out. But if you want to read more about this, Haxter wrote an article about it that talks</p><p>a bit, I think they downplay the problem a bit, because I think the problem is actually</p><p>more of an issue than some people say, &ldquo;Oh, it only happens if you have internal pulldowns</p><p>enabled, da da da.&rdquo; But no, I think it&rsquo;s a problem any time you&rsquo;re doing any kind of</p><p>input with high resistance pulldowns on the output, which if you&rsquo;re doing low power work,</p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing certain kind of bit bang protocols like I2C, if you&rsquo;re doing those by hand, would</p><p>that require an external pulldown resistor? So yeah, just be warned, there&rsquo;ll be lots</p><p>of links in the show notes about all this if you want to look into it more.</p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s disappointing to hear on such a popular chip, right at the beginning to run</p><p>into a showstopper bug like that. Does it occur on all the pins, all the GPIOs?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Oh, okay.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think maybe the ADC pins in some cases, it doesn&rsquo;t affect</p><p>them because the analog buffer gets turned on instead of the digital GPIO buffer. But</p><p>all the digital pins, definitely. Yeah, pretty frustrating. I think most people won&rsquo;t see</p><p>a problem, but I&rsquo;ve seen a problem with buttons and I&rsquo;ve seen a problem with the cap touch.</p><p>Which is one of your favorite things to do.</p><p>Yeah. No, it&rsquo;s like, I was like, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to just use this as a drop-in replacement</p><p>for some of my existing boards on Tindy,&rdquo; and nope.</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>Yeah, lol. So yeah, what&rsquo;s your number two this week?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned a couple of times on the show that I have a 3D printer from Bambu Lab and</p><p>they&rsquo;re back in the news again after Stratasys has sued them for patent infringement. Stratasys</p><p>created 3D printing back in the late 80s and through that and their acquisition of MakerBot</p><p>just over 10 years ago, hold most of the patents related to 3D printing today. I&rsquo;ve linked</p><p>to two articles from Ars Technica and Tom&rsquo;s Hardware that have really good coverage in</p><p>the show notes that go into far more detail than I will. In question are 10 patents and</p><p>two jumped out at me, the heated build platforms in Purge Towers. Both of these are pretty</p><p>standard in 3D printers, which raises the question, are their patents still valid or</p><p>is there prior art that may invalidate the patents? Phil Torrone of Adafruit asked this</p><p>question a few weeks ago when this hit the news. He suggested that someone like the Open</p><p>Source Hardware Association should start a database to catalog prior art to see if the</p><p>patents could be invalidated. I&rsquo;m wondering if it actually needs to be a database or could</p><p>prior art be tracked in something simpler, similar to an awesome list and simple markdown</p><p>on a GitHub page, for example. I&rsquo;m half tempted to start a list myself, but I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>I have the context in the industry to get the list right. This isn&rsquo;t the first time</p><p>a prior art search has been done against Stratasys&rsquo; patents either. Doing some search engine queries</p><p>prepping for the show, there were calls just over 10 years ago for prior art to fight some</p><p>of these patents, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell if anything ever came out of it. I&rsquo;ll link to the articles</p><p>that I mentioned with coverage of the story in a Reddit thread with some speculation about</p><p>why Stratasys is going after Bambu Lab and not other companies. Again, it&rsquo;s just speculation.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to say they&rsquo;re conspiracy theories, they&rsquo;re just theories. It probably just comes</p><p>down to the fact that Bambu Lab has had a large amount of success in a very short amount</p><p>of time. They&rsquo;re afraid of losing market share of their large commercial 3D printers to an</p><p>upstart consumer 3D printing company. I&rsquo;ve heard so many patent issues with Stratasys.</p><p>One of the things I think that started the whole consumer 3D printing revolution back</p><p>in 2006 or 2007 was that one of the key patents that was about the, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to melt</p><p>plastic and squirt it out using a CNC-controlled nozzle,&rdquo; that went out of patent in the mid-2000s</p><p>or something. Thus, we got RepRap and then we got MakerBot and Prusa and all these others.</p><p>Every 3D printer is because of this patent being finally expired. I remember hearing</p><p>one of the reasons why a lot of these consumer 3D printers don&rsquo;t have heated build chambers</p><p>is because Stratasys still had the patent on heated build chambers, and so everyone</p><p>just had heated platforms. Then, people would say, &ldquo;Well, you know, if you put your heated</p><p>platform 3D printer in a small box from Ikea, your prints would be much better.&rdquo;</p><p>Right. Stratasys&rsquo; headquarters is about 15 minutes from my house here in the Twin Cities,</p><p>and I&rsquo;m just half tempted to drive over there, knock on the door and go, &ldquo;What the hell</p><p>are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>But obviously, they look at this as defending their patents and their revenue streams, so</p><p>I see both sides of it. It&rsquo;s still very frustrating for things that are very common today to still</p><p>have patents against them.</p><p>Yeah, super frustrating, especially for things that seem pretty obvious, but this is the</p><p>world we have to play inside of, I guess.</p><p>And I did look. A number of those patents don&rsquo;t expire until the mid-2030s, so there&rsquo;s</p><p>still over 10 years to go on some of them, which is quite a long time.</p><p>Yeah. I&rsquo;m on the crossfingers that we&rsquo;ll find a way.</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s our show. Thank you for listening.
