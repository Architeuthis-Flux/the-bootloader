It acts as a bridge between your iOS device and your Adafruit IO feeds. There is support for Apple Shortcuts, which means that you can log health data, home data, any data that’s on your iOS device. You can also read feeds from the device and have Adafruit IO affect tasks on your phone. I’ve worked on two guides with it so far. The first uses a Qualia board with a round display to show photos from my photos app. I’m able to encode the photo in a Shortcut, send it to an IO feed and then decode it with CircuitPython. I’ve also worked with using Matter devices in Apple HomeKit with itsaSNAP to log sensor data and also to control an RGB light strip. I’m really excited about all of the functionality and I’m looking forward to seeing what people do with it.\nitsaSNAP Intro Learn Guide Qualia S3 Photo Frame Health Status Board 5:09 Raspberry Pi AI Camera Module (Tod #1) There is a new camera module from Raspberry Pi. It’s an “AI” camera. What does that mean? It appears as a regular camera to the Pi, plugs into the CSI camera port. The “AI” part is that it has an RP2040 and 16MB of flash to store a pre-trained AI model you upload to it.\nThis is the kind of Machine learning (oh I mean “AI”) I prefer: on the edge, at the device, rather than in the cloud. The ML models live in the camera module. Results are delivered frame-synced alongside regular camera data over I2C.\nYou upload models via I2C too. It takes several minutes to upload an 8MB model. And like all these AI models are static, they don’t learn: their categorization is baked-in. This is expected but I think means you can’t use newer techniques with models that learn.\nThere’s really good docs so far. Easy-to-use command-line tools and a nice Python library.\nMore on-device ML devices please.\nRaspberry Pi blog post Hackster hands-on article Getting started Picamera2 repo demo videos: Pose estimation, Object detection Also see:\nPerson sensor by UsefulSensors $10 We talk about in Bootloader Episode #3 Twitter thread with my eye that follows you 10:05 The Bumpin’ Sticker by Guy Dupont (Paul #1) Guy Dupont creates his take on the “Keep Honkin’ I’m Listening to…” bumper stickers. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, a screen from Ali Express, a Particle IoT board, and his Last.fm account, the screen dsiplays a bumper sticker with what Guy is currently listening to.\nGuy Dupont on The CircuitPython Show Guy Dupont MakerChat on CircuitPython Day 2024 The Bumpin’ Sticker YouTube video GitHub Repository Guy’s latest project: Meet @slambot 13:40 Nothing To See/Hear : Wireless Fuzz Pedal (Liz #2) I follow quite a few guitar pedal folks on instagram and saw the newest post from @different.noises last week. It’s a “wireless fuzz” that completes the circuit by transmitting it via an infrared LED. The circuit converts the signal from the guitar to headphone audio level and then again into light that is sent out the infrared transmitter to an infrared LED. He includes the schematic in the post as well as an explainer and a few demo videos to prove that the signal is in fact transmitting via infrared.\nNothing To See/Hear : Wireless Fuzz Pedal Post different.noises on Instagram 16:10 X1Plus alternative open source Bambu X1 firmware (Tod #2) I’ve been thinking of getting a new 3d printer. My Prusa mk2.5s has seen better days. And I’m wowed at the literal 2x speed improvement I could get out of a Prusa mk4s or a Bambulab X1. So when I discovered this X1Plus alternative firmware for the X1, I was intrigued.\nThe X1Plus firmware runs on the “application processor” (AP) board of the X1, (sort of like what Octoprint does for me currently). It doesn’t touch the motion control system. And seems like all does to the the AP firmware is patch the bootloader to also look for a firmware file on the SD card, and use that if present. So you can always go back to stock firmware quickly.\nAnd the team behind it have started a CrowdSupply campaign for an expansion board X1Plus can use for extra features light lights and cameras. I don’t think I’d want this, but I’m glad they’re finding a funding path for the keep them going.\nX1Plus X1Plus expansion board crowdfunding Hackster article Also to consider: Craftcloud 3D printing service\nI’ve done a few runs using Craftcloud and the results are pretty good. Like renting a Bambu. Craftcloud is a service front-end for a bunch of additive manufacturing companies across the US. Some offer metal as a material. Their quoting system is pretty easy just to get an idea of the cost. As an idea of costs: it costs about $4 per piece (inc shipping) for a typical synth enclosure.\n22:31 Maker (and more) Skill Trees (Paul #2) Steph Piper aka Maker Queen has created Maker Skill Trees as a way to track your progress across a range of skills. These include things like PCB Design, 3D Printing and Modeling, and Dev Boards to crafting skills like Crochet, Knitting and more. There are almost sixty different skill treens to pick from. Each skill tree has 73 skills or experience hexagon tiles, with basic skills at the bottom to more advanced skills at the top.\nThere’s a web app to create your own skill tree apps designed by Shane Gadsby.\nThere’s also a book in development with an even more expansive range of skill trees, tools to track your progress and calculate your life score across all areas.\n","categories":"","description":"Welcome Liz Clark","excerpt":"Welcome Liz Clark","ref":"/the-bootloader/blog/2024/10/07/welcome-liz-clark/","tags":"","title":"Welcome Liz Clark"},{"body":"Welcome to The Bootloader.\nI’m Tod Kurt.\nAnd I’m Paul Cutler.\nWe have a special episode for you today as we welcome our first guest, Liz Clark of Adafruit Industries.\nLiz, welcome to the show.\nHey, thanks so much for having me on.\nI’m glad you could be here.\nWe’ve each brought two things to share.\nWe’ll chat about each one for a couple of minutes, but no more than five.\nLiz, why don’t you start us off?\nAll right.\nYeah.\nSo as Paul said, I work with Adafruit Industries.\nAnd so as a result, I have to confess my first choice is a little biased.\nIt’s the Adafruit It’s a Snap iOS app.\nAnd I’m mildly obsessed with it.\nI’ve done a couple of Learn Guides with it recently.\nAnd this app is done by our iOS developer, Trevor.\nAnd it basically acts as a bridge between your iOS devices and your Adafruit I/O feeds.\nSo if there’s ever been something on your phone that you’ve wanted to log to Adafruit I/O or have Adafruit I/O control something on your phone, now you can do that.\nAnd the way that you build it up is using Apple shortcuts.\nAnd if folks don’t know, in Apple shortcuts, you can kind of make these like mini scripts using kind of these little widgets.\nSo you can kind of you can even use scripting things like if statements, you can do Base64 encoding, all that kind of stuff.\nSo there’s a lot of functionality.\nRecently, I’ve done two guides using it.\nThe first was I used a shortcut to send my iOS photos up to Adafruit I/O using Base64 encoding.\nAnd then I’m using a Qualia S3, which has an ESP32 S3 on it, with a 720 by 720 round display to take the data down from the Adafruit I/O feed, decode it, and then display it on the display.\nI just think that’s really awesome because otherwise you’d usually have to like create all the bitmaps or JPEGs ahead of time so it’d be able to be displayed.\nBut this you can kind of do it on the fly just by like running the shortcut, sending it to the I/O feed if it’s a snap.\nSo I’m really into that.\nAnd then the other one that I did is using Apple HomeKit using off-the-shelf smart home devices.\nI used a temperature and humidity sensor and a light sensor.\nAnd I was able to get that data into Adafruit I/O and display it on a dashboard.\nAnd then the final thing is I got a light strip that’s a matter-controlled light strip.\nAnd I was able to set up kind of a feedback loop where if I change the value on a feed in Adafruit I/O, it would send a text to my phone.\nAnd then I was able to use a text automation with shortcuts so that it would then control the light strip.\nSo basically I’m able to change the value on the dashboard and control the light scene, which I think is really cool.\nAnd then I was able to write some CircuitPython code to use a feather TFT with some buttons.\nSo I’m controlling the light strip from the feather using this kind of bridge in between.\nOh, very cool.\nYeah.\nSo I’m really excited about it to snap.\nI think Trevor’s done a really awesome job with it.\nHe also has his own guides.\nHe’s done a health status board where he’s able to log all his workouts for the week.\nAnd he’s also done a weather project.\nYou can send the weather from your phone for your location up to Adafruit I/O as well.\nAnd with weather projects, you often have to have an API key and all that.\nBut this, you avoid all that.\nYou’re just sending the data straight to it.\nAnd then with CircuitPython, you can just read the feed directly and display it.\nI liked his project using the health kit with the health statistics.\nIt showed how many steps he had taken for the day.\nAnd I could totally see putting something like that on my desk to guilt me into getting the 10,000 steps a day that I need.\nAbsolutely.\nYeah.\nTotally.\nYeah.\nThe whole shortcuts thing, I really want to get into it because Apple has forever had this on the desktop, this AppleScript language, which is this weird English-like language that you can use to have programs talk to each other, which is fascinating.\nAnd so I think shortcuts is built on that.\nI think so.\nYeah.\nAnd so by Trevor making an app that’s just another shortcuts participant, everything else that speaks shortcuts, which is every other app on the phone or on the iPad, can now participate.\nAnd now you can do what you did, like send photos up trivially using MQTT or whatever.\nYeah.\nIt’s just so crazy.\nYeah.\nAnd I’d never used shortcuts before or anything like that.\nAnd once you get into it, it kind of blows your mind because it’s all the stuff you can automate.\nAnd every app does seem to have its own functions that are available too.\nYeah.\nI think Apple almost mandates that you have certain shortcut capability.\nYou can open a file, save a file or something.\nWhen you submit an app to the App Store, it’s like, “Hey, you need to implement this to become part of the ecosystem.”\nOkay.\nGotcha.\nWell, that was a good first one.\nTod, what do you have for your first one this episode?\nEven though I was a big machine learning person back in the day, I’ve been very down on most of the modern LLM “AI” in quotes, if you can see my fingers making air quotes, AI stuff.\nBut there are certain cases where I’m a big fan of it.\nAnd Raspberry Pi just introduced a new camera module for their Raspberry Pi little computers.\nIt’s called the AI Camera.\nAnd it plugs into the normal CSI port of Raspberry Pi, just like any other camera you’d get for the Raspberry Pi.\nBut it’s got a little bit of extra special sauce.\nAnd some of that extra special sauce is that it’s got an embedded RP2040 microcontroller with 16 megabytes of flash.\nAnd what that’s doing is it’s snooping on the camera data and you can use it to have a pre-trained AI model loaded up into the camera module.\nAnd so you just get down the video feed and then the machine learning results.\nIt’s like synced to the camera over I squared C over the single cable.\nAnd so this like offloads all the hard work of doing machine learning stuff on the Pi and puts it in this little camera module, which is pretty cool.\nAnd philosophically, I love these where the models are running on device at the edge, rather than where they have to make a network request out to the world that is charging you some dollars per request.\nAnd it might go down.\nAnd so it’s pretty interesting that they’re able to get the functionality and stick it in the camera module.\nAnd so you just talk to it like a normal camera.\nAnd then if you want to talk to it like a normal camera plus some other stuff, you can load up some machine learning model into it.\nLike the two demos they give are a pose estimation.\nSo it can just look at the video and kind of see how a human is positioned in 3-space, like where their arm is, where their head is.\nAnd one of the other examples is sort of the hello world of vision machine learning, which is the object detection.\nSo you like hold up a coffee cup to it.\nIt’ll draw a rectangle around it and say cup.\nAnd so these are just the demos they give out.\nThey’ve got a whole repo with a bunch of other examples.\nAnd the show notes, there’ll be links to all this.\nThere’s a pretty good Hackster article that shows them trying to use it and getting started with it.\nBut there’s also a GitHub repo, a really nice getting started guide on the Raspberry Pi documentation website.\nAnd Adafruit has these in stock or they had them in stock.\nI think they’re out of stock currently.\nI was surprised to see that they’re $70 more than the cost of the Pi itself.\nBut when you actually look at all the functionality, it kind of starts to make sense.\nYeah.\nI mean, I think one of the reasons why it’s so much more expensive, because you’re thinking, oh, if it’s just essentially a Raspberry Pi Pico and a webcam module smashed together, why is that like double the price?\nWell, it’s like they’re actually using a really good camera module.\nThey’re using this Sony FX100 module.\nBecause with this machine learning stuff, it’s really garbage in, garbage out.\nSo having a really good image sensor to get the best quality image you can before you feed that through your model is really important.\nSo they have a really good sensor on the front end, better than the most sensors.\nSo I was thinking of getting this module mostly just because it’s a good camera.\nAnd then playing with AI stuff, because I don’t really have a use for doing this sort of stuff.\nIt might be fun to maybe turn on lights when I walk in the room or something.\nI don’t know.\nBut yeah, so that’s out now.\nAnd it’s cool because I know when I’ve tried to do machine learning stuff on the Pi, just running models on the Pi is kind of a pain.\nYes.\nSo I saw that all go by when it came out, and I didn’t look too into it because I assumed it was just a camera.\nI didn’t realize it also had the RP2040 on there.\nSo that’s really cool.\nAnd 16 megabytes of flash.\nYeah.\nAnd if you’re looking for a similar idea to have it be much cheaper, is for the last two years now, there’s been this little $10 board called the Person Sensor by Useful Sensors.\nYou can get them at SparkFun.\nThey have them in stock right now.\nMe and Paul talked about this back in episode three of the bootloader.\nAnd this is around Halloween time as well.\nSo I made at that time a little CircuitPython eyeball that would track you around the room as it recognized your face.\nAnd so it’s much simpler.\nIt’s running on a very cheap STM32 with a really cheap little webcam sensor.\nBut it’s $10, and it can recognize a face to tell you if a face is looking at it, which is really useful for a lot of cases.\nLike if you’ve got some sort of UI that you want to save power and have some of it powered down when no one’s paying attention to it.\nBut if you walk up to it, it’ll light up.\nIt’ll turn on.\nIt’ll say, “Hey, I’m here.\nPress this button to go.”\nSo I think having people detection without having to know who the person is, is really useful.\nAnd both of these cameras can do that.\nAnd if you just need that, spend $10 instead of $70.\nSo yeah, so that’s my first one.\nHow about you, Paul?\nWhat’s your first one for this week?\nMy first one is the Bumpin’ Sticker by Guy DuPont.\nI love all of Guy’s projects, probably because so many of them have a musical take to them.\nI had him on the CircuitPython show a couple of years ago, and he also did a maker chat with Liz this past August on CircuitPython Day.\nAnd I’ll link to those in the show notes as well.\nIf you haven’t come across Guy’s projects before, you should definitely check them out.\nThe Bumpin’ Sticker project is a take on the bumper stickers you might have seen on some cars that say, “Keep honking.\nI’m listening to insert your favorite band here.”\nExcept with the Bumpin’ Sticker, Guy is sharing what he’s listening to in real time.\nHe picked up an HDMI screen from AliExpress for about $60 and hooked it up with a Raspberry Pi.\nHe used his Last.fm account, which tracks everything you listen to, which is hooked up to his Spotify account.\nThis lets you use almost any streaming service with the project as long as you have Last.fm, so it doesn’t matter if you’re using YouTube Music, Apple Music, Spotify, et cetera.\nHe then wrote a couple of TypeScript programs using Valtown that scrapes his Last.fm page.\nAnd then lastly, he added a Particle IoT board with cellular service.\nThat board gets the data of what he’s listening to, I think via JSON from the Valtown TypeScript program, passes it to the Raspberry Pi, which then generates the image and displays it on the HDMI screen as a bumper sticker on the back of his car.\nHe also shows how he wired it for power from the car’s wiring and how he mounted all of it and even weatherized it.\nAll in all, it’s a really cool project.\nI loved that project.\nJust how all the pieces came together.\nI also think the video is an excellent explainer on how it all worked.\nThe video is so good.\nYeah, so good.\nIt’s excellent.\nYeah, he does such a great job.\nAnd I think in the time that he’s released that in the last couple of weeks, he’s already released two new projects just this week that I’m trying to catch up on.\nHe even has a new Mastodon bot account that I won’t spoil, but I saw him post up today.\nYes, that was the one that I saw this morning.\nSo we’ll link to that in the show notes as well.\nExcellent, I haven’t heard of this.\nThere’s two aspects of his project that I really enjoyed as a nerd.\nOne is the HDMI display he used wasn’t like your standard 4x3 or 16x9 display.\nIt’s like a 4 to 1 format.\nIt’s like this really long rectangle.\nI think it’s meant to be like a smart rear view mirror or something, but it’s like it’s the size of a bumper shape of a bumper sticker rather than like, obviously a screen.\nAnd so to have it change when it’s on the back of his car and it changes, you’re like, wait, that wasn’t a bumper sticker.\nThat’s something else.\nYeah.\nI can’t imagine driving around Boston and actually encountering that and trying to figure out how that was actually done.\nAnd the other is it.\nOh, yeah, sorry.\nGo ahead, Liz.\nSpeaking as someone who’s around Boston, that probably wouldn’t even be the weirdest thing you see on the road that day.\nAnd the other thing is he’s using this thing called Valtown, which is a like their little slogan is, if GitHub Gists could run and AWS Lambda was fun.\nIt’s like there’s all these services out there that will run code for you and charge you and all that kind of stuff.\nBut Valtown is free for like trying it out and doing some like open source stuff.\nAnd it is just like you have a function and you say, go run this function when this happens, like when this URL comes in.\nAnd that’s pretty cool.\nI’ve been wanting to have a project that uses this because it looks like actually kind of interesting and fun to play with.\nTime to dust off your JavaScript and TypeScript skills.\nYeah, totally.\nAll right, Liz, what’s your second one for us?\nSo my second one’s a little bit of a left turn from my previous one, but it’s the nothing to see/hear wireless fuzz pedal.\nSo I follow quite a few guitar pedal folks on Instagram and newest post from different noises last week is a wireless fuzz, quote unquote, that completes the circuit by transmitting it via an infrared LED.\nSo the circuit converts the signal from guitar level to headphone audio level, and then again into light that’s sent out through an infrared LED into a transmitter.\nAnd what I love about different noises is he includes a schematic for all his custom pedals.\nSo if you scroll through his feed, it’s just schematics of pedals you could breadboard together real quick.\nAnd he includes some video explaining the circuit and also proving that when he blocks the IR light, there is no sound.\nAnd when he lifts it back up, you have it.\nAnd he said he got it to think about 50 feet between the LED and the transmitter.\nSo it’s still like a kind of a standard fuzz circuit.\nIt didn’t seem to affect the sound of it.\nOf course, fuzz is always a little low fidelity to begin with.\nBut I just think it’s so cool.\nI love when people like figure out weird ways to transmit signals, you know, whether it’s like an audio jack for a soldering iron or, you know, anything like that.\nSo I thought that was really cool.\nAnd in general, his work’s always really interesting.\nI was looking at his Instagram page and I love, like, there’s this whole community of pedal builders and DIY electronic builders that work on these strip boards.\nAnd they have these like way of describing how the circuit is both like how you would build it by just saying like, this is where the parts would go on the strip board.\nAnd it’s just really beautiful because it’s like the strip board is like a horizontal rows of copper are connected and that’s how the holes are.\nSo it’s sort of like breadboards, but, you know, it’s a whole 20 pin row is connected.\nAnd so you can like make these pretty complicated circuits without really much wiring.\nYou just have to be really clever on where your components straddle the rows and stuff.\nAnd so it’s really fun to look at them just without even knowing what they’re doing.\nIt’s like little cityscapes.\nAnd I love the DIY guitar pedal community, similar to the maker community.\nThey’re always sharing.\nThey’re really welcoming.\nAnd it’s just folks having fun experimenting.\nVery cool.\nTod, what’s your second one for us?\nAll right.\nWell, so I’m kind of sniping one of your topics a little bit here, Paul, because you’re the one who’s got the Bambu printer.\nSo my 3D printer, it’s a Prusa Mark 2.5 S that I’ve had for, I don’t know, six or so years.\nAnd it works great.\nBut, you know, in the intervening years, 3D printers have gotten much better, like surprisingly to me, but like the Mark 4 S Prusa and the BambuLab, they both literally print twice as fast as my printer.\nLike I loaded up profiles for both and like sliced it and see how long, like what the slicer said it was going to take.\nI’m like, oh, really?\nCome on.\nSo I’ve been, I’ve been looking around.\nI’ve been trying to figure out, should I go Prusa again?\nBecause open source, you know, but I really like having the enclosed frame.\nAnd so I’d love to, so like the BambuLab X1 is really appealing to me because of that.\nAnd so I stumbled upon that there is an open source firmware for the Bambu, which kind of blew my mind.\nAnd it’s sort of like, it’s a, it’s a thing that, that modifies the application processor board of the X1.\nSo the X1 apparently works kind of like a, like my Prusa with Octoprint, where there’s the Octoprint Raspberry Pi that kind of controls the user interface.\nAnd then there’s the motion control system that is controlling the actual motors and the extrusion of plastic and stuff.\nAnd the Bambu is set up very similarly.\nAnd this open source firmware called X1 Plus only runs on the application processor and only modifies it slightly so that it will run an alternate firmware off of the micro SD card.\nSo if you want to run, if you want to go back to running stock Bambu, you still can.\nBut if you want to run this new open source version, you can try it out.\nAnd this new open source firmware is just basically a different user interface.\nIt doesn’t affect the motion control aspect of the printer.\nSo it’s still going to be fast and good and all that kind of stuff.\nAnd so, so I’ve been like, huh, maybe this is the path I take for a new printer is, is I kind of do both closed source and open source at the same time.\nAnd the reason why I discovered this is because the people behind the X1 Plus firmware also have come out with a crowd supply campaign for an expansion board that will let you add like more cameras or lights or other sort of sensors and actuators that you can trigger via your G code or whatever.\nAnd so it’s not, it’s not required to run the firmware, but it’s like a, if you have the firmware, you can use this cool extra little plugin board and do a bunch of other, other interesting stuff.\nSo that’s why, that’s what I’m kind of thinking right now.\nIt’s like, should I, should I get a new printer?\nAnd should it be one of these?\nShould it be a Bambu with this new crazy open source firmware, which is very intriguing.\nI don’t know if it’ll run on your printer.\nCause I, Paul, cause I think yours is a P, a P1, is that right?\nI have a P1P and yeah, I did look at it.\nThat was the first thing I looked for and nope, this is just for the X1 Carbon.\nSo the higher end one, I was too cheap to get the open source version I guess.\nBut I’m, I’m interested to hear that, that you’re thinking about joining the dark side and going with a closed source printer, even though you could argue that the new Prusas aren’t very open source to begin with either.\nAnd this is almost a luster of two evils.\nYeah.\nThat’s the thing is I’ve, I’ve been doing open source printers since like the very first MakerBot.\nAnd so yeah, it’s, it’s the fact that Prusa has been going more closed sources has even made me think of going to other printers that are not, not open because, because of that aspect.\nAnd so yeah, it’s, it’s still, it’s still in the thought processes for me.\nOne of the things that’s, that’s forestalled my choice is there is a service called CraftCloud, which is a website you can go to and submit, upload an STL and it will essentially request quotes from hundreds of 3D printer companies across the U.S. and then it’ll, it’ll sort them by price and you can, and other features that you care about.\nAnd then you can order like one or, or in my case, I ordered like a, like a small batch of like 10 and 20 of a little synthesizer enclosure.\nAnd the quality was great.\nIt was from some company in Georgia and, and you know, they shipped within like, they printed in two days and shipped within, I mean, it got here to me in like two days.\nSo it was like about a, like less than a week of time, physical time.\nYeah, it’s great.\nSo I’m like, well, geez, maybe I just don’t get a fancy new printer.\nMaybe I just use this service for some of the things I care about.\nWell, that is a consideration.\nHow many times have you heard someone buy a 3D printer and a year later, it’s just sitting there collecting dust too.\nExactly.\nAnd, and, and, and the costs are, the costs are right at the, at the, right at the perfect place of where I’m like, ah, you know, if it was a little cheaper, I just would use this all the time.\nBut if it was a little more expensive, I just would buy the 3D printer.\nI would recommend that if you’re looking at printing ABS, but especially ASA, which isn’t nearly as bad as ABS to get the X1 carbon.\nIf you’re only going to stick with PLA and PETG, any other printers are good enough to print PLA these days and get the speed increases that you’re talking about.\nBut that enclosure really makes a difference, especially for ASA being the common one and ABS probably a little more uncommon.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI’m not really into those fancy plastics, but.\nI had the same printer that you had, Tod, and like three or four years ago, I updated to a Creality Ender and it was kind of amazing to see just the, the jump in performance.\nYeah.\nI think you would definitely appreciate it.\nYeah, totally.\nAnd I will say, Noe is considering the Bambu X1 right now.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt’s so good.\nI mean, the thing is, is that, is that the, the Mark II, my Mark II 5S, it has been an appliance where like I’ve got Octoprint running and I will just send a print job to it knowing that like, oh yeah, I cleaned the bed three days ago and that’s clean enough for the thing I’m doing.\nAnd I just print and I can watch it on the camera.\nI’m like, yep, it’s printing.\nThere’s nothing wrong.\nFor the longest time, 3D printing was never just an appliance.\nIt was always this like little, little fiddly thing you were messing around with the entire time, doing, doing more to it than getting out of it.\nAnd so, yeah, it’s it’s kind of amazing.\nIt is.\nIt really is.\nAll right, Paul, what’s our final thing for this week, this month?\nThis one I’m very excited about.\nSteph Piper, aka Maker Queen, is a library makerspace manager in Queensland, Australia.\nShe’s come up with a great way to visualize your skill level and skill gaps in 45 different disciplines with her Maker Skill Trees.\nSimilar to how in a video game, when you get enough experience points to level up, you can put skill points into your character to get better.\nThis is the same concept, but for you.\nIt can help gauge where you are in your learning journey for each of the different skills.\nEach skill is made up of 73 hex boxes.\nYou start at the bottom with some of the basic tasks and work your way up at both skill and complexity.\nYou don’t need to do them in order, though they get a little harder the higher up you climb the skill tree.\nWhat’s also neat about it is that it might show some gaps that you might have in a given skill.\nAnd now you’re incentivized to try something new and fill in those gaps.\nOr for the person that says, what do I do or what do I learn next?\nThis has plenty of inspiration to draw from.\nJust a few of the almost 60 disciplines are 3D modeling, 3D printing, amateur radio, coding, cooking, crochet, Dungeons and Dragons, music, PCB design, robotics, sewing, woodworking, and so many more.\nThat’s just a small selection.\nSo you can see that there’s things from the maker world, the crafter world, the coding world, and all of those have Venn diagrams that probably cross over each other in so many different ways.\nSteph Piper gave a great talk on the maker skill trees at the Open Source Hardware Association earlier this year.\nIt’s under 10 minutes long and it’s worth watching to learn more about it and I’ll link to it in the show notes.\nShe’s also working on a book that uses the skill trees, including 13 makerspace skill trees, self-reflection activities, and a life progress dashboard for how you are doing across many of the skill trees.\nI think it’s definitely worth checking out and everyone, every makerspace should have a copy of this printed, I think.\nThat’s really cool.\nAnd I am a really visual person, so I appreciate having it all laid out.\nSome things that you may forget or not think about or not know about, like you said.\nSo it’s really cool.\nI really like Steph Piper’s work in general too.\nYeah.\nShe made a very conscious decision that it should be printed on paper and should be a tactile experience filling in those boxes, circling them or crossing them out or however you want to do it and get you off the screens to do it.\nI like how it’s laid out as a sort of a honeycomb hexagon thing rather than a tree where there’s like a linear progression because when you’re learning stuff, it’s never a linear progression.\nYou might bust ahead really far on certain topics, but still be like down farther on other topics.\nAnd so having it be sort of like, oh, this amorphous, you just kind of grow from the bottom towards the top is really nice.\nI agree.\nYeah.\nWell, that’s our show.\nFor detailed show notes or to join our newsletter, please visit thebootloader.net and a special thank you to Liz Clark for joining the show this

These modules comprise the same parts in modular synth setups: oscillators, filters, envelope generators, LFOs, sequencers, etc., but Microrack modules are small, cheap, and hackable. They’re just exposed PCBs, using the solderless breadboard as a mounting plate and for power distribution.\nWhile I’m a big fan of Eurorack modular synths, I have a hard time recommending it to newcomers because it’s so expensive to get even a basic sound. This could bridge that gap. Microrack looks to be compatible with Eurorack and by its nature, it’s compatible with the kind of random breadboard-based music hacking I do in Arduino and CircuitPython.\nAnd you don’t need Microrack to do modular synth stuff on a breadboard. I do it all the time, but it’s kind of annoying: interfacing to other gear is flaky, jacks \u0026 knobs aren’t breadboard-friendly, input \u0026 output level conversion is tricky, etc. Over the years there have been various attempts to make this easier. I’ve linked a few in the show notes.\nMicrorack links:\nMICRORACK Kickstarter MICRORACK demo videos Sonicstate interview w/ MICRORACK at Superbooth Similar past projects:\nBreadboard Friends by Mutable Instrument’s Émilie Gillet EricaSynths EDU DIY LABOR Korg littleBits Synth Kit 8:16 Pimoroni’s Picade Max Arcade (Paul #1) Paul has been talking about building a standup arcade for years. Pimoroni just launched the Picade Max, a bar top arcade you assemble yourself for £495 or about $650. It works with the Raspberry Pi and includes a 4:3 19\" screen with HDMI driver board. It includes everything you need to get started, minus the Pi, such as joysticks, buttons, and speakers. The Picade Max Control Board is the interface to the Raspberry Pi 5 and is itself powered by an rp2040 and works just like a normal gamepad / keyboard. The sound is also powered by an rp2040, the Picade Max Audio Board, that acts as a USB soundcard with 3 watts of power and a rotary encoder on the rear to control the volume. It’s powered by the Power HAT for the Raspberry Pi.\nParadise Arcade Shop Picade Max at Pimoroni Tom’s Hardware coverage and review Tom’s Hardware Pi Cast with guests Paul Beech and Phil Howard of Pimoroni 13:17 Pico2 / RP2350 GPIO Input issue (Tod #2) To start: I would not recommend using the Pico2 or other RP2350-based boards for new users. There’s some weirdness going on in the silicon of the new RP2350 chip that makes inputs sometimes not return the correct logic value. Instead, an input may get stuck HIGH with no easy way to recover.\nI found this out because the way touchio works in CircuitPython: it takes a GPIO pin, turns it to an output and sets it HIGH, then it turns that pin to an input and waits for it to go LOW. The time that takes is an indication of if that pin was touched. I filed a CircuitPython bug, discovered there was an “RP2350-E9” errata in the chip that seemed to only cover the case when using the internal pull-down resistors, but which also seemed to be affecting us. I couldn’t find a way around it after hacking a few hours in the CircuitPython internals for digitalio. Then Dan Halbert looked into it and filed a bug both with Micropython and with Raspbery Pi. This then was confirmed by Philip Howard at Pimoroni and Ian at Dangerous Prototypes (maker of Bus Pirate).\nThankfully Hackster wrote up an article about it, but I think it downplays the issue a little. I don’t see how this can be fixed in software and will limit the kinds of circuits we can use the RP2350 with.\nFrom what I can tell the following uses will not work:\nCertain ways of wiring button inputs Capacitive touch sensing Bit-banging open-collector protocols like I2C Links:\nMy original touchio CircuitPython issue MicroPython issue filed by DanH pico-feedback issue filed by DanH Bus Pirate Mastodon post referencing it Hackster article about RP2350 GPIO issue 18:36 Stratasys sues Bambu Lab over 3D printing patents. (Paul #2) Stratasys, an early pioneer in 3D printing who also acquired MakerBot in 2013, has sued Bambu Lab. The lawsuit focuses on PEI-coated build plates, purge towers, and automatic bed leveling.

I’m Paul Cutler.\nAnd I’m Tod Kurt. If you want to learn more about this podcast, visit thebootloader.net\nfor show notes and transcripts, and where you can also find our new newsletter.\nPaul, two weeks ago on 16th of August was CircuitPython Day. We were honored to be an\nofficial part of it with a special live video version of our podcast. You can check that\nout on YouTube, and we provide a link in the show notes. I just thought we’d like maybe\ntalk a little bit about the experience of the entire CircuitPython Day in our live show.\nBut first, I’d like to say thank you so much for organizing all of that.\nOh, it was nothing.\nLike not all of CircuitPython Day, but like for our part of it was all organized by you.\nI just kind of showed up. So thank you so much.\nIt was my pleasure.\nThe format was we first talked about what CircuitPython had been doing for the last\nyear in terms of like its features and updates and how it’s in its relationship to MicroPython.\nWe each talked about one project that each of us had done. It was really nice to hear\nyour Song Matrix thing because it straddled so many different technologies because it\nwas a network project that dealt with MQTT and the Shazam API. I don’t do much internet\nstuff with my little electronic devices that run CircuitPython. So it was really cool to\nsee all that and to see like real Python working in concert with CircuitPython.\nYeah that’s one of the really neat things about the project. I’ve got a couple of projects\nthat do that, but actually writing real Python on a Raspberry Pi and then writing CircuitPython\nand having those talk to each other is just, that’s what excites me about CircuitPython\nis that those physical devices that you can touch and feel. It’s just something better\nthan just seeing code on a screen.\nTotally. And it kind of reminds me of the synergy that a lot of web developers got when\nwe were able to write JavaScript code that ran in the browser and also JavaScript code\nthat ran on the backend using Node or something. So it’s like we’re getting that same level\nof like, “Oh I don’t have to switch gears too much because I’m still writing Python.”\nJust different flavors of it.\nAnd then my project, I made this like two weeks before CircuitPython Day, I made this\nlike plan that I’m going to design and build and code a little playing card sized drum\nmachine and it didn’t quite turn out because I made some tiny mistakes. So I’ve got 10\nof these boards and I’m wondering, should I even like fix them up and put them in the\nstore? But it was a fun experiment. I tried doing a similar thing a couple of years previous\nwith CircuitPython Day and that worked out pretty well. So this was a good learning experience\nfor me. And if anybody has seen this little drum machine playing card thing that I made,\nif anyone is interested in one, let me know and I’ll see if I can send you one.\nAnd I think it’s cool that the project didn’t actually work out and you talked about it.\nSo many projects are, “Look, I did this and it just all worked,” but that’s not how it\nis in real life, right? We all have challenges and things break and it’s good to actually\nshow that side of a project.\nYep.\nWell, what’s your first one this episode for us?\nAll right. Synthesizers. Have you heard of them? So one of the things that I’ve been\ninto is modular synthesis. So it’s the kind of mad scientist synthesizers you might see\nwith all the knobs and lights and all the cables that plug in. And the way this all\nworks is that each little module does one specific part of the whole synthesis process.\nAnd so you have something that might make a noise and then you have something else that\nshapes that noise’s loudness and another module that shapes that noise’s frequency response,\nsort of a tone control. And then things that will produce different pitches that control\nthe thing that makes noise. And so it can get really expensive really fast. And so people\nwhen I’ve talked about modular synthesis, they’re like, “Oh, that sounds really cool.\nI want to get into it.” It’s like, well, it’s really expensive to get into if you’re not\nbuilding the stuff yourself or if you’ve just decided to sort of like, “This is my hobby\nand I’m going to sink a couple hundred dollars into it every couple of months.”\nAnd so if you wanted something else that was modular synthesis but was not as expensive,\nwhat were your options? It’s like, well, there are some of these software programs out there\nlike VCV Rack that will do the sort of virtual on your screen modular synth. And that’s actually\na really cool way to get started. But it’s a thing on a screen. And one of the whole\npoints of modular synthesizers and physical synthesizers and physical things in general\nis to get yourself away from screens. And there’s also the other problem of if you’re\ntrying to build some of this stuff yourself, the things that you will be interacting with,\nlike the jacks you plug cables into and the knobs you turn, those don’t work well on a\nbreadboard. There’s always problems where you’re like, as you’re turning the knob, the\npotentiometer will come out of the breadboard because they’re just really not made to be\nplugged in like that. And so what’s the solution? And I’ve been seeing some noise about this\nthing called MICRORACK from this synth get-together, the synth conference called Super Booth a\nfew months ago in Germany. And lately I’ve been inundated by Instagram ads for its Kickstarter\ncampaign, which I’m like, man, Instagram has me targeted. And so MICRORACK is a collection\nof little PCB modules that plug into a breadboard, just like all these other things we might\nhave that like Adafruit sells, except they are modular synthesis modules. So instead\nof being several hundred dollars for each little module, it’s a little like each little\nmodule does the same functionality as these synth modules, but they just plug in and you\nwire them together, little jumper wires like you do on a breadboard. And so it’s really\nnice. It’s inexpensive. The way you interact with it is very much the way you interact\nwith stuff on breadboards. So if you’re used to doing stuff on breadboards, this is like,\noh, this will fit right in. And they’ve got a pretty rich set of modules, it looks like.\nAnd they’re using the Solaris breadboard mostly as a power distribution and a mounting platform,\nwhich is great. It’s like, oh, here’s this very common plastic thing with lots of holes.\nLet’s use it as a mounting board, essentially. I’ve become a backer of it. I’m going to hopefully\nit’ll be out. They’ve been making modules for like six months or a year, and they’ve\nbeen showing them off for several months now. And so I’m hoping it’s a real thing. It looks\npretty real. And if anything, it’s going to be a nice way of solving some of these problems\nof how do I get the knobs to not move around when I’m prototyping something? Because I\nprototype my own little synthesizers on breadboards, and their modules, like some of their modules\nare just like little knobs that have outputs. I’m like, that’s perfect.\nLike you were saying at the beginning, I looked into EuroRack a couple of years ago when I\nhad some interest, and it was just so overwhelming. I had no idea where to start. And like you\nmentioned, the cost quickly went up and up. And I thought about just buying a couple of\nmodules from just Winterbloom and starting there, but I still found it pretty overwhelming.\nBut this is something I might check out. Do you remember how much it was roughly on Kickstarter?\nI think for like, they’ve got like a starter kit that’s around like 80 bucks or whatever\nthat contains like a good handful of modules. I think the most expensive thing you can get,\nwhich contains all their possible modules is like 300 or 400, which is the cost of one\nmodular synth module if you go to a store that sells them. So in terms of I think modules\nper dollar, it’s one of the highest that’s out there. I’m mostly interested in it since\nI developed some of my own little music gizmos. I’m mostly interested in using it as little\npieces of potential UI that I will have in my synthesizer. I’ll just like use their knobs,\nuse their jacks, that kind of stuff. There have been other similar, let’s make some of\nthis audio stuff more breadboard friendly little things that have been out there. I’ll\nput some links to some previous ones in the show notes. One of those famous ones is called\nBreadboard Friends by Mutable Instruments, Emily Gillette. It’s like two of the main\nproblems with the synth stuff on when you’re prototyping some stuff is how do you do jacks\nand knobs? The other one is how do you do power? Because the Eurorack standard is all\nthe signals are plus minus 10 volts. And your breadboard, like everything you do on a breadboard\nis usually like three volts or five volts. So it’s like one of the main things it solves\nis how do you make that work?\nVery cool. So how about you? What’s your number one today?\nI’ve been talking about building a standup arcade for probably 20 years from when I first\ngot a set of ROMs, the actual arcade games you load into an emulator to play. About five\nor six years ago, I finally started it. And living here in the Twin Cities, we have a\nlocal company called Paradise Arcade, who has a focus on the community around fighting\nsticks, fight stick controllers for fighting games. But they have a wide selection of arcade\nparts, including buttons, joysticks, and the hardware to hook them all up to a computer.\nI drove down to their shop, which is more of a warehouse and not a retail shop, which\nI didn’t know at the time. But they were pretty awesome and helped me out. From there, I bought\nplans on the internet to actually build the cabinets and then bought the MDF to do it.\nBut I’ve never done woodworking. So this has all been in fits and starts over the last\ncouple of years. I haven’t worked on it in a year or two, though I plan to pick it up\nagain in the next few weeks as I have that itch again.\nThe point of the story is, if I had to do it all over again, there’s a solution that\nlooks to be a lot easier. Pimoroni is taking pre-orders for the PiCade Max, a bar top arcade,\nnot a stand up, that sits on top of a desk or a bar, hence the name. It includes everything\nyou need to build it, just add a Raspberry Pi 5. The kit includes 6mm powder coated MDF,\ntwo player controls, and a 19 inch screen and 5/4 aspect ratio, just like original arcade\nmonitors.\nWhat’s really innovative about the PiCade Max are the add-on boards that come with it.\nThere’s the PiCade Max Power Hat, which powers both the Pi and the screen at 5V and 12V.\nThe PiCade Max USB controller board supports up to 24 buttons and two 4-way joysticks that\nconnect via USB-C. This itself is a deal, as the wiring harness I bought for mine was\nabout $100 just by itself.\nAnd then lastly, there’s the PiCade Max USB audio board, which has two screw terminals\nfor a pair of speakers and is an I2S audio DAC with a 3W amplifier and volume control\nvia a separate encoder board. What’s really innovative is that these last two boards are\npowered by the RP2040 and connect via USB-C to the Raspberry Pi 5. Pimoroni mentioned\nin an interview with Les Pounder at Tom’s Hardware that they’ll be selling these two\nstandalone boards in the future, and I know I want to check out the audio board for sure.\nThe PiCade Max kit retails for £495, or about $650 with the current exchange rate. That’s\nreally not that much compared to how much it would cost to build it yourself and take\nit from me. And it’s about 50% lighter and not nearly as heavy as using normal MDF to\nbuild the cabinet. Of course, I don’t want to know what shipping would cost across the\npond for that. I’ll link to a couple articles from Tom’s Hardware with their coverage, as\nwell as the PiCast show on YouTube, where host Les Pounder had Paul and Phil from Pimoroni\non to talk all about it.\nThat’s really cool. There have been a few retro arcade using a Raspberry Pi things over\nthe years, but they’ve always been sort of, “Oh, if you can find these random parts that\nI happen to have in my garage, if you can find the exact clones, you can use my plans.”\nBut having something like this PiCade Max could make it really easy just to, “I’m going\nto build it this weekend.”\nYep. And you do need to set aside time. Paul from Pimoroni joked on the stream that they\ndid that his speed run of doing a complete installation was like two hours. And that’s\nsomeone who knows what they’re doing and has probably done it before. So you need to put\na good chunk of time to do it. But then again, it’s taking me years and years to work on\nmine. So this sounds like it would probably be a lot faster.\nNo kidding. Yeah. And I’d love to get the link to the place in your area where you actually\ngot some real arcade hardware. Because I used to be really into that. I used to have a couple\nof stand-up arcade machines. They were old Atari Vector things that were always dying\nbecause that was kind of their normal state of things. They were in, once these old games\nget past a certain age, they’re kind of always failing, it seems like.\nYeah. And it’s really neat. They have everything from PCBs for a couple of games to mounting\nhardware to they custom make some PCBs. And then they’ve got the whole fighting stick\nstuff. But I’ll make sure to link to Paradise Arcade in the show notes too, because they\nship internationally.\nYeah. And the cool thing about the PiCade Max being separate boards is you can take some\nof the Pimoroni stuff and use it with an existing sort of arcade platform that you’ve already\npartially built. If you are kind of stuck on the wiring harness problem of how do you\nget these joysticks and buttons and speakers hooked up to whatever you want.\nAnd I’ve been worried about sound because just doing the 3.5 millimeter out from a Raspberry\nPi isn’t, you know, it’s still a little tinny. But yeah, I’m excited about that because I\nreally want to check out the audio board. It’s got the two pairs of speaker terminals\nso you can use a real pair of speakers with it, not just some cheap computer speakers.\nTotally. Yeah.\nWhat’s your next one for us?\nSo yeah, well, OK. So at the beginning of August, on August 8th, Raspberry Pi introduced\na new microcontroller board, a successor to their popular RP2040 Pico. It’s the Pico 2\nand a new chip that powers the RP2350, which is a great chip. It’s like they’ve improved\nit in almost every manner. Like it’s it’s got a like a twice as fast dual core set of\nCPUs in it. It’s got extra PIO if you’re doing that sort of weird protocol stuff. It’s got\ntwice the memory. Just oh, it’s a lower power. You know, even though it’s twice as fast,\nit’s lower power. So it’s just all around a really good update. And I’ve been really\nexcited as I’ve been slowly getting some of these RP2350 based boards in to test. Since\nit’s twice as fast and almost all the stuff I do with the chip is in CircuitPython or\nsynthesizer stuff, both of which are really compute intensive. Having a chip that’s twice\nas fast means I can do essentially twice as much, twice as many synth voices or something\nor twice as fast response time. And as I was testing it out, I learned that the capacitive\ntouch library in CircuitPython called TouchIO wasn’t working with it. And I looked, started\nlooking into it, found a bug on the CircuitPython GitHub. As I was looking at it with my oscilloscope,\nI discovered that there’s this errata that was in the data sheet called E9 that is a\nproblem with the actual hardware, where if you’re using a GPIO pin on this chip in a\ncertain way, mostly as an input, it will latch up and stay at 2.2 volts instead of like high\nor low. And so the way the capacitive touch sensing works in CircuitPython and a lot of\nother systems is you have a pin and it drives that pin high for like 10 microseconds. And\nthen it turns that GPIO pin into an input and watches how long it takes for that pin\nto go low. And that time that it takes is basically it’s discharging the capacitance\nof whatever the line is connected to, like a little capacitive pad. And when you human\ntouch that pad, that changes that capacitance. And so the time it takes to go from high to\nlow changes. And so with that, you can get a really good sense of like, oh, was something,\nhas something touched the capacitive pad or not. But because of this pin is sort of like\nstaying high or not staying high, staying at 2.2 volts, which is kind of not quite high,\nbut it’s definitely not low. It means that touch I/O doesn’t work. It also means that\ncertain kinds of button inputs won’t work either that have like certain low or certain\nhigh of resistance pulldown resistors, or if you’ve configured internal pulldowns in\nthe chip. And so I’m at this point, I’m not recommending people use the Pico 2 or the\nRP 2350 if they’re newbies, because it’s got this weird input problem where you don’t\nknow is it not working because of my wiring or is it not working because you’re tickling\nthis weird input bug on the chip. And thankfully, Dan Halbert has looked at, Dan Halbert, who’s\na core CircuitPython developer, he looked into it in much more detail than I, and he’s\ncreated a bunch of really good test cases that he’s opened issues up on the Raspberry\nPi GitHub and on the MicroPython GitHub. And so there’s a bunch of good data and the relevant\npeople have been notified. So hopefully there’ll be a fix. I don’t know if there’ll ever be\na software fix. We might have to wait for the next version of the Pico 2 chip to come\nout. But if you want to read more about this, Haxter wrote an article about it that talks\na bit, I think they downplay the problem a bit, because I think the problem is actually\nmore of an issue than some people say, “Oh, it only happens if you have internal pulldowns\nenabled, da da da.” But no, I think it’s a problem any time you’re doing any kind of\ninput with high resistance pulldowns on the output, which if you’re doing low power work,\nif you’re doing certain kind of bit bang protocols like I2C, if you’re doing those by hand, would\nthat require an external pulldown resistor? So yeah, just be warned, there’ll be lots\nof links in the show notes about all this if you want to look into it more.\nYeah, it’s disappointing to hear on such a popular chip, right at the beginning to run\ninto a showstopper bug like that. Does it occur on all the pins, all the GPIOs?\nYeah.\nOh, okay.\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think maybe the ADC pins in some cases, it doesn’t affect\nthem because the analog buffer gets turned on instead of the digital GPIO buffer. But\nall the digital pins, definitely. Yeah, pretty frustrating. I think most people won’t see\na problem, but I’ve seen a problem with buttons and I’ve seen a problem with the cap touch.\nWhich is one of your favorite things to do.\nYeah. No, it’s like, I was like, “Oh, I’m going to just use this as a drop-in replacement\nfor some of my existing boards on Tindy,” and nope.\nJust kidding.\nYeah, lol. So yeah, what’s your number two this week?\nI’ve mentioned a couple of times on the show that I have a 3D printer from Bambu Lab and\nthey’re back in the news again after Stratasys has sued them for patent infringement. Stratasys\ncreated 3D printing back in the late 80s and through that and their acquisition of MakerBot\njust over 10 years ago, hold most of the patents related to 3D printing today. I’ve linked\nto two articles from Ars Technica and Tom’s Hardware that have really good coverage in\nthe show notes that go into far more detail than I will. In question are 10 patents and\ntwo jumped out at me, the heated build platforms in Purge Towers. Both of these are pretty\nstandard in 3D printers, which raises the question, are their patents still valid or\nis there prior art that may invalidate the patents? Phil Torrone of Adafruit asked this\nquestion a few weeks ago when this hit the news. He suggested that someone like the Open\nSource Hardware Association should start a database to catalog prior art to see if the\npatents could be invalidated. I’m wondering if it actually needs to be a database or could\nprior art be tracked in something simpler, similar to an awesome list and simple markdown\non a GitHub page, for example. I’m half tempted to start a list myself, but I don’t think\nI have the context in the industry to get the list right. This isn’t the first time\na prior art search has been done against Stratasys’ patents either. Doing some search engine queries\nprepping for the show, there were calls just over 10 years ago for prior art to fight some\nof these patents, but I couldn’t tell if anything ever came out of it. I’ll link to the articles\nthat I mentioned with coverage of the story in a Reddit thread with some speculation about\nwhy Stratasys is going after Bambu Lab and not other companies. Again, it’s just speculation.\nI’m not going to say they’re conspiracy theories, they’re just theories. It probably just comes\ndown to the fact that Bambu Lab has had a large amount of success in a very short amount\nof time. They’re afraid of losing market share of their large commercial 3D printers to an\nupstart consumer 3D printing company. I’ve heard so many patent issues with Stratasys.\nOne of the things I think that started the whole consumer 3D printing revolution back\nin 2006 or 2007 was that one of the key patents that was about the, “Oh, I’m going to melt\nplastic and squirt it out using a CNC-controlled nozzle,” that went out of patent in the mid-2000s\nor something. Thus, we got RepRap and then we got MakerBot and Prusa and all these others.\nEvery 3D printer is because of this patent being finally expired. I remember hearing\none of the reasons why a lot of these consumer 3D printers don’t have heated build chambers\nis because Stratasys still had the patent on heated build chambers, and so everyone\njust had heated platforms. Then, people would say, “Well, you know, if you put your heated\nplatform 3D printer in a small box from Ikea, your prints would be much better.”\nRight. Stratasys’ headquarters is about 15 minutes from my house here in the Twin Cities,\nand I’m just half tempted to drive over there, knock on the door and go, “What the hell\nare you doing?”\n“What?”\nBut obviously, they look at this as defending their patents and their revenue streams, so\nI see both sides of it. It’s still very frustrating for things that are very common today to still\nhave patents against them.\nYeah, super frustrating, especially for things that seem pretty obvious, but this is the\nworld we have to play inside of, I guess.\nAnd I did look. A number of those patents don’t expire until the mid-2030s, so there’s\nstill over 10 years to go on some of them, which is quite a long time.\nYeah.

I’m a big fan of synth libraries for microcontrollers. My favorites are Mozzi for Arduino and CircuitPython’s synthio, but I’ve also use Teensy Audio Library, Daisy, and others. All have the startup issue of “how do I get things wired up to make sound?” and then they require a good amount of programming \u0026 synthesis knowledge too.\nThe Tulip Creative Computer project tries to solve these problems, and many others. I’ve been following Tulip and it’s gotten really interesting. Tulip is an ESP32-based device you can buy right now for $60, which includes a 7\" touchscreen, high-quality audio DAC, MIDI I/O, and a battery. It runs a custom version of MicroPython and is made to have a USB keyboard plugged right into it so you can code on it directly, no computer needed!\nAs you code it in MicroPython, it can be like a live-coding music environment, sort of like SonicPi, but without the hassle of getting a Rasperry Pi running. Tulip boots up instantly.\nOh and did I say it’s a device? It’s also a fully-open source project you can build yourself from an ESP32-S3 and touchscreen and the Tulip designers provide multiple guides depending on what hardware you have.\nAnd to get back to synth libraries, Tulip uses the AMY synth library, which has bindings to both Arduino and Python. It’s a fascinating take on a synth library, going in a more high-level direction than Mozzi and synthio and is extremely cross-platform.\nI have a Tulip coming my way in the next week.\nTulip homepage Build your own Tulip Floyd Steinberg’s video on Tulip AMY - Additive Music librarY 18:27 More new IDEs - ViperIDE and Zed (Paul #1) ViperIDE Continuing my review of various IDEs, ViperIDE is a brand new IDE in a web browser focused on MicroPython, with CircuitPython support created by Volodymyr Shymanskyy.

Leah is a professor at University New Mexico and for the last few years has been applying CNC and advanced mathematical techniques to ceramics and clay, creating shapes with overhangs and angles that I wouldn’t think possible in clay, let alone 3d printer plastic. They use commercially-available clay 3d printers with some special tricks.\n(If her name is familar, she is also creator of the Lilypad Arduino sewable electronics system about 15 years ago, the echos of which we see in the CircuitPlayground Express boards from Adafruit)\nHer team’s newest project is called “CeraMetal”, a way of 3d printing metal on the desktop using a custom metal clay. Once it’s printed, it’s fired in a kiln and sintered into a solid metal part. The custom metal clay is made from metal powder, xanthum gum and a few other ingredients, mixed together.\nTo slice the model to be printed, standard slicers like Cura can’t be used. Once the CeraMetal clay starts extrusion, it just keeps coming out. Normal slicers stop extrusion and do travel moves. So they had to write their own slicer to support this continuous extrusion aspect of the material.\nThe print resolution is close to standard PLA printing: 0.6mm nozzle, 0.3mm layer height. The costs are around $2k, for printer and kiln, compared to the $50k-$130k for a Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) machine.\nAnd as an aside, they mention the algorithm used to get equal area spacing in their slicer is Fermat Spirals. These are space-filling curves that have the property that the area between its lines are equal. Perfect for 3d printing. I love spiral algorithms and so I’ve been looking into these.

It requires a Matter controller such as some Google Nest devices, Apple Homepod or AppleTV, or some Amazon Echo devices. For example, you can buy a Matter-supported smart bulb and set it up with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, or Amazon Alexa—without having to worry about compatibility.\nScott Shawcroft, CircuitPython’s lead developer, shared he is working on CircuitMatter, a pure Python implementation of some of the Matter specification that will be compatible with CircuitPython and potentially MicroPython.\nWhat is Matter? - Wired Magazine Matter and Home Assistant Sparkfun Thing Plus Matter dev board 29:47 Special Announcement about CircuitPython Day 2024 Tune in to the Adafruit YouTube channel on CircuitPython Day, August 16th for a special live stream of The Bootloader with Paul and Tod.

And I’m Paul Cutler. Tod and I each have a couple of\ninteresting things to share with you, and you’ll want to stay till the end of the episode for a\nspecial announcement. But first we have a special interview with Debra Ansell. Debra is known\nfor her work with LEDs and you can find her at geekmomprojects.com. She also goes by Geek Mom\nProjects on Instagram and Mastodon, which I’ll link to in the show notes. Debra, welcome to\nthe show. You were at Teardown 2024 this past June. Tell me about Teardown.\nHi, Paul, thanks. And it was a wonderful experience. I still have, you know, warm fuzzy\nflashbacks to moments that happened there. So I’m really happy to talk about it. It was\nunreservedly the best MakerCon I have attended. Now I haven’t attended a wide variety of them,\nbut I’ve attended a number. And I think there were a confluence of factors that made it such a fun,\nenjoyable, stimulating, welcoming event. So that’s an open ended question. But I’ll start with\nfor people who don’t know what Teardown is, I strongly recommend finding and maybe you can link\nto this on your website, an interview that Helen Leigh had with David Groom about what Teardown is\nand what goes into it, because she gives a really good explainer from an insider’s perspective. So\nI will probably, you know, misstate the purpose of it and all that. But from my perspective, it was\na place to go, bring some projects, find people who are interested in similar projects or might\nhave different interests, but that are in the same world space that really are happy to talk about\nthem and want to share them and, you know, meet like minded people and kind of see what’s going\non in the community in person where you can have real conversations one on one or in small groups.\nAnd it was a really wonderful combination of attending talks, hanging out with friends who I\nhad a group of friends whom I knew would be there, meeting new people from a wide range of backgrounds\nand circumstances, and, you know, meeting some people I’d met only online and meeting some people\nI’d never met before. And there were some people who didn’t know about it and came last minute who\nI would like fit in perfectly there. I’d mentioned the talks, there were workshops, there were\npeople, there was great food and drink that Helen took great pains to source from interesting local\nrestaurants in the Portland community. And there was a chance to explore Portland. They took great\ncare to not only have, you know, talks and presentations during the day, but provide events\nover the couple days before and the day after and evening events where we could all kind of unwind\nand hang out in slightly different spaces that give you a chance to see the local environments.\nAnd, you know, hang out in a fun place that was a little different. So you’re constantly getting to\nsee a little bit, things that are a little bit new, explore Portland with, you know, people who may\nnot know it either, and talk tech, but in interesting ways.\nWhat was one of the highlights of the city of Portland for you?\nThe highlight, in an interesting way, they went out of their way to create a geocaching style\nscavenger hunt event, which they put a tremendous amount of effort into, and I think was very clever\nand not everybody was into it. I like a little game like this in a competition so that you ended up\ndivided into teams and you had to run all over Portland to pick up these clues, which they were\nmagnets hidden to whatever magnetic thing they could find in various landmarks all over the city.\nNow, it turns out our team, not so good at the clues, but incredibly persistent. So we probably\nwent about three times the mileage that you were supposed to do.\nSure.\nAnd we were actually conventioning and complaining a great deal, but it was a great bonding\nexperience. It was actually, it was, I knew none of the people on my team super well. And by the\ntime we came out of this, what probably should have been a much shorter event than we made it, we\nhad bonded tremendously over this whole chance to run around Portland, look for these clues, decode\nthese puzzles. And again, not everybody was into it. And we certainly lost a few people along the\nway, but got a certain sense of satisfaction out of finishing with this group. And I learned about\nthe bridges in Portland, which are maybe the nice ones, and which is that apparently there’s\ndifferent colleges in there. So I thought that was a fun way to integrate the city into the\nconvention. And also they had scheduled, for example, a dinner the first night at Autodesk that\nis near to where Tear Down was. And the convention itself took place in the Lloyd Center, which is a\nsemi-abandoned mall. And that in and of itself became kind of a character in the convention,\nbecause it is semi-abandoned, but in this weird, wonderful way that there are a few, there’s an\nAnnie’s Pretzels and there’s a, there’s probably a Cinnabon somewhere. And those typical mall\nstaples, and then a lot of empty storefronts that locals, that you can rent for cheap. So locals\nhave taken it over and there’s like, they’ve converted one retail store into a roller skating\nrink. You like look inside the storefront, there are people roller skating in circles, and there’s\nstill an ice skating rink downstairs. So it’s this kind of interesting, wonderful fantasy location\nthat you could, you’re in a mall, and I grew up in the 80s in malls. So maybe that’s personally\nresonant with me. For me in particular, it was a lot of fun because I, it was in a converted GAP\nstore. And I had recently made a batch of denim jackets as my most recent project of illuminated\nLED denim jackets. So they were perfect as an installation in a GAP store. And I got to display\nthose too. And I got to use the GAP theme in my, instead of GAP kids, it was GAP LEDs.\nOh, that’s awesome.\nIt was fantastic and not my idea. I have to give Allie, my friend Allie, who was there, all the props\nfor coming up with that idea. And she said it and I said, wait, that’s perfect. And she helped me\nstyle my display and made it fun. It let your imagination run wild a little bit. It was a\ncharacter. It was a presence in and of itself to be in this mall at this convention.\nThat’s very cool.\nYeah.\nSpeaking of the mall, what were some of your favorite installations at Teardown?\nWell, of course, I’m partial to the LED installations. And Ben Henke, with the help of\nClaire Cassidy, put together a wonderful Pixel Blaze demonstration with all the wonderful things\nyou can do with Pixel Blaze LED controller. Jason Coon, you know, who’s a good friend of mine, a\ngood maker friend, brought a number of his Fibonacci boards and put together. And it was nice\nbecause you get, you got a reserved space in the GAP store. So his went up across a wall and that\nwas the LED lounge area. So they were, they had put beanbags and a sofa beneath it. So you could\nlounge surrounded by beautiful LED art installations. And then I got to meet and talk to\nsomebody who had only briefly really talked to before, Aisha, and I cannot pronounce her last\nname, who does wonderful LED PCBs and gave a really great talk there. Oh, and a friend of mine,\nCharlyn Gonda, who is, goes by Charlyn online, had brought her LED jewelry, a subset, but it’s\nstill wonderful and amazing to look at. So that’s the LED overview. And it was all wonderful. But\nthere were also other fun things like somebody brought an electron microscope, which I didn’t\nhave a chance to check out, which I’m sorry I didn’t, but showed people how to use it. Somebody\nwas showing, I guess it’s not as much an installation, but it was, it wasn’t a workshop.\nThey had a wire bonding machine and I had never seen, you know, people wire bonding, you know,\ndies on, you know, tiny, tiny PCBs before. And that was fun to watch. So I’m sure there’s much\nmore and I’m, I may pop up with something in the middle of this interview, but, but it was\nactually really fun the way you were kind of lounging amongst all the installations. And yeah,\nI was certainly drawn to and appreciative of all the LED art that was there.\nWe were chatting before we started recording about the vibe of the convention.\nWhat were some of the other things that, that fed that vibe?\nI give all the props in the world to Helen Leigh, who really poured herself, heart, mind, and soul\ninto organizing it. And Josh Lifton, who I think runs CrowdSupply for letting her run with it. And\nalso obviously doing a lot to make it work as well. But from the beginning, Helen, you know,\nshe worked, clearly worked very hard on it and reached out quite early to people to say, you\nknow, we’re looking to create this inclusive, diverse, interesting, welcoming environment.\nAnd you do have something to contribute. So she set a tone and an expectation early.\nShe ambitiously, you know, took on a venue that didn’t come with wifi or anything built in,\nbut obviously spent a lot of time thinking about what could work and did a very good job of it.\nBecause Teardown last year was at Portland State University. So this was a new venue for them.\nFirst of all, the first step was the expectation setting that this is a place for everybody.\nLike, you know, do you know anybody who maybe hasn’t spoken before who’d like to,\ndo you know somebody who has, who doesn’t get recognition for what they do, who should,\nyou know, be displaying here. And so it was clear from the beginning that this was going to be a\nwelcoming environment, whether or not you’re a big name or, you know, very casual hobbyist with an\ninterest. And that was really nice. And it was designed with conversation and connection in mind\nvery clearly from the layout of the spaces by building in lounge areas where people could sit\nand talk to building in gaps in the schedule that were really, for me, who, you know,\nI get a little overwhelmed being in large crowds of people for a long time.\nI could either talk to people or I could kind of just duck out and have like a few moments\nto myself without feeling like I was missing too much. I appreciated that on both fronts.\nThe time, the space, the planning of events, of social events afterwards that, like, you know,\nI mentioned, you know, going to Autodesk for a big party for planning this, you know, these team\ngeocaching hunt all over Portland for planning a meeting at a video game bar that made it very\neasy to engage with others and like, you know, something of interest to kind of everybody. And\nfor me, you know, there’s some people who just want to go and talk nothing but tech,\nwhich is great too. You could certainly do that, but it gave you other interesting things to look\nat and comment on too. So it put it all in kind of the context of you’re in this city that is a\ngreat place to be. And let’s all bring all these projects and topics that we love together here,\nbut let’s also interact with, you know, the community around us, or at least, you know,\nfind out what’s interesting in the community around us while we’re here. So it’s engagement.\nThere’s a lot of engagement, a lot of planning. It was nicely planned and nicely announced. So\nyou knew what was going to happen at any moment. There was no trying to figure things out. A lot\nof space was provided. I think what also contributed to the vibe was it was a conscious decision\nat Teardown, for example, not to have badge hacking, because while it’s, you know, it’s a\nwonderful and exciting event, I’m not sure why they did this. This is my take on why not having\nbadge hacking was actually a positive in this circumstance is it can introduce a level of kind\nof competition and one-upsmanship that was absent. And it also can drive people to kind of work\nsolo, which again, they produce amazing things. And at the end, it’s very cool,\nbut really the events were designed for communication and connection. So I think\nthat was purposely omitted from the roster. So yeah, a lot of factors were just kind of\nwell thought out. And I think to also went to great lengths just to make people feel included,\nas I mentioned to you, I think before the show, you know, a great icebreaker. You know,\nwhen I go to a convention like this, I always feel like I’ve found my people because you always have\nsomething in common to talk about. And my big icebreaker question is if I don’t know what else\nto say, so what are you interested in? What do you like to do? Because people always have a good\nanswer to that. One of the people I asked said, you know, I’ve just been interested in learning\nabout programmable electronics. I didn’t know anything about it, but I was told to come by\nand, you know, learn about them here. And so complete newbie, but he had a great time.\nHe was, and people were really happy to talk to him. You know, every maker I’ve ever met is super\nhappy to talk about what they’re doing and show it off. So it was, you know, he had a great time\nlistening to people and people were happy to encourage him and to give him tips to, you know,\nwhere he might go to pursue his interests. So it just felt like it was kind of an equalizer\nbecause there were also some people, there were people with pretty big YouTube followings who,\nyou had maybe a parasocial relationship with them, but it was, you know, but you got a chance to just\nkind of talk to them and they’re normal people too, just as much as the guy who’d never done\na single electronics project, you know, by himself. And yeah, you just had this feeling\nthat kind of everybody was in the same space, sharing the same experiences.\nThat is awesome to hear. What a great conference.\nYeah. Yeah, it really was wonderful. Really had a great time. And it didn’t hurt that\nsome of my favorite makers who I do know and adore were there and we just brought the party,\nbut it was a party that everybody was really happy to engage in. So, you know, it was great.\nAnd I’ll link to some of those makers in the show notes as well.\nDebra, thanks so much for being on the show.\nOh, Paul, it’s my pleasure. Thanks for having me.\nThanks to Debra for that interview. Teardown sounded like a really good time.\nYeah, I was bummed I wasn’t able to go to this year.\nIt sounds just like a great group of makers there between Charlyn and Jason Coon and Ben\nHenke, I think was there, she said. Yeah, all the cool folks.\nYeah, all the folks that I would want to actually meet someday. So I might have to put this one on\nmy bucket list as well. Yep.\nWhat’s your first one for us this episode?\nAll right. So you know me, I’m all about the DIY synth stuff.\nI’m a big fan of synth libraries for microcontrollers. Some of my favorites are the\nMozzie for Arduino synth library and CircuitPython’s Synth.io. But I’ve also used the Teensy Audio\nLibrary, which is sort of the standard bearer for a lot of the good audio projects out there.\nAnd there’s also Daisy, the Daisy Seed, which is like used in professional products.\nAnd there’s others. But all of them have the problem of, you know, how do I get things wired\nup to make sound? Because they’re a library. They’re not a physical thing. And then once you\nhave something that actually makes sound, it still requires a good amount of programming\nand synthesis knowledge to make something that sounds cool.\nWell, there’s this project that’s been around for a while called the Tulip Creative Computer,\nand it tries to solve some of these problems. And it solves a bunch of other problems too.\nBut the main one is like, how do you make music? I’ve been following it for a while,\nand lately it’s gotten really interesting. It’s a ESP32 based device you can buy right now for\n60 bucks. It includes a seven inch touchscreen, high quality audio deck, MIDI I/O, a battery,\nand yeah, ESP32 processor on it. It runs a custom version of MicroPython,\nand it’s set up so you can plug in a USB keyboard and just start typing into it directly. You don’t\nhave to have a computer to program it. You can program it by itself. And because you’re, you\nstart out with just the REPL, the MicroPython REPL, it’s sort of a live coding music environment.\nIf you want it to be like the Sonic Pi project, which is really fun by the way, if you have a\nRaspberry Pi and want to make music kind of live coding, I highly recommend trying out Sonic Pi.\nBut unlike the Sonic Pi, there’s no hassle of getting a Raspberry Pi running.\nBecause it’s a microcontroller, it just starts up instantly. It’s just kind of cool. But wait,\nthere’s more. Did I say it’s a device? It’s actually a fully open source project,\nand you can build one yourself if you’ve got an ESP32 S3 board and a touchscreen.\nAnd the Tulip designers provide a bunch of guides depending on what specific hardware you have.\nSo you can like kind of cobble together from parts you might already have in your\nshoebox full of electronics to make your own little Tulip thing. There’s also a\ndesktop Tulip emulator if you want to try it out just like on any computer that runs Python.\nAnd to get back to the synth libraries, on the physical microcontroller side,\nTulip uses the Amy synth library, AMY, which is the C library that has bindings in both Arduino\nand Python. And it’s a really interesting take on a synth library in that it doesn’t\ntry to be super low level. It mostly tries to say, “Here’s a bunch of synthesizer recreations\nwith patches you can just load up.” So you don’t have to like hook things together like a modular\nsynth the way you have to do in Mozzie or Synth.io. You just like say, “Load up this DX7 sound,” and\nyou get to play electric piano or whatever. And it’s got drum machines and a bunch of other things.\nYou can go low level if you want, but by default, you don’t have to. So I have a Tulip coming.\nShould be here maybe next week. And I’ll include links to all this in the show notes.\nI watched the video that we’ll link to, and you didn’t even touch on one of the cooler parts. So\nyou start off at the REPL, but then you just hit an icon in the lower right-hand side of the screen,\nand you can choose from different modes. You can put it into synthesizer mode or drum sequencer\nmode. So to your point, you don’t need to know the libraries and the coding to actually make\nthat happen. If you do, you get that level of control, but they also have a UI for all of that,\nwhich I thought was really interesting. Yeah, and the way that it’s set up is that\nyou can have all these functions, the drum machine function, the synthesizer functions,\nkind of all running in the background, and you can still have the REPL controlling it.\nLike you essentially controlling it via MIDI, or MIDI as in quotes. If this was a video,\nyou’d see my fingers going wiggle wiggle. It’s really interesting because in Arduino and\nCircuitPython, to rewire the synthesizer, you essentially stop the synthesizer, rewire it,\nstart it back up again. But in the Tulip case, while it’s running, you’re kind of unplugging\nit in real time and reloading things and changing it and stuff. And so it’s really interesting.\nI can’t wait to play with it. Yeah, for 60 bucks, how can you go wrong?\nTotally right. That was my number one. So Paul, what’s your number one this week?\nI’m going to go back to the well on code editors. I didn’t know that I had a thing for testing code\neditors, but apparently I do. After previously talking about JetBrains fleet way back in\nepisode three and recently covering the CircuitPython online IDE by River Wang, I have two\nmore to share. First up is ViperIDE, an online IDE for MicroPython and CircuitPython, made by\nVolodymyr Shymanskyy, I hope I pronounced that right. I apologize if I didn’t, who is the co-founder\nof BlinkIO, an IoT cloud platform. Like other browser-based solutions, ViperIDE requires Chrome\nor Edge because it requires web serial to work, which isn’t available in Firefox or Safari.\nOne of the really innovative things about it is that you can connect your boards via USB like you\nwould expect, but there’s also support for web REPL over the internet or local network, Bluetooth,\nand P2P WebRTC support. It includes features you would expect in an IDE, including syntax\nhighlighting for Python, JSON, TOML, and more, and it has a viewer for markdown files and can\nauto expand and minify JSON files just like a big IDE would. You can also install it as a\nprogressive web app so it looks and feels like an app, not just a browser or browser tab. And it\nincludes a terminal, and I’m putting quotes around that. What you really see is the REPL, the serial\nconsole. Unlike any of the web editors who do have a serial printout, this includes that, but the\nterminal also allows you to interact with the REPL, which is really cool, and I haven’t seen it in\nanother online IDE. It’s definitely MicroPython-focused. For example, there’s buttons for\nsoft reset and hard reset, which is handy, but the hard reset button doesn’t work in CircuitPython\nas it calls the machine function used in MicroPython to reset it. It also includes support\nfor MicroPython’s package manager right in the IDE, making it simple to import libraries.\nIt’s running MicroPython compiled to WebAssembly right in your browser, and you can even try it\nwith an emulator in your browser as well. It’s really well done. I’ve included links to a review\nfrom Les Pounder at Tom’s Hardware and Mr. Shymanskyy’s recent visit to the PyCast show as well.\nNext up is another editor called Zed. Zed’s been around for a little less than a year for macOS\nand just recently released a Linux version, which is how it caught my eye. This is an editor in IDE\nfor folks who miss Atom or Sublime Text and don’t need all the features of a full-blown IDE,\nlike features found in VS Code or PyCharm, like a profiler, for example.\nZed is from the creators of Atom, and it’s also open source. Right from their home page,\nhere’s how they describe Zed. Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor,\nand unrelenting performance keeps you in the flow and makes other tools feel slow.\nYou’ll note I said “multiplayer” in the description. It includes the ability for\nmultiple developers to collaborate and edit code together within a shared workspace,\nwhich is similar to JetBrains Spaces. If you’re collaborating with someone, it has the ability\nto jump to your teammate’s location right in the code and vice versa, and has a built-in screen\nsharing tool. There’s a few things it doesn’t have, such as Git integration, but if you’re\ncomfortable at the command line, that’s really not a big deal. It also doesn’t automatically pick up\nPython virtual environments. You have to edit a JSON configuration by hand and point to the\nlocation of your virtual environment. And then one other thing that I did discover that was\ninteresting is that it uses pyright as a linter right out of the box. pyright is a static type\nchecker for Python, and I opened my big web app with built-in fast API and had all these squiggly\nlines with pyright telling me that all my code was wrong, and I did a double-take. I’m like,\n“No one’s telling me my code’s wrong,” so I was digging into what pyright is.\nBut if you’re an intermediate to advanced user and you’re okay at the command line and just want a\nfast code editor, check out ZADD. I’m giving it a chance as my daily driver, and so far I’m really\nliking it. Yeah, I’ve been running it for a couple weeks now, using it to edit CircuitPython and\nMarkdown files. And yeah, it’s fast and pretty easy to set up. It kind of reminds me of Sublime\nText, but like Sublime Text from five years ago or whatever, when it was simpler. It’s definitely\na lot simpler and faster than VS Code, which has become a bit ungainly to me. There’s just too many\nextensions now, and it’s like there’s too much choice. The paradox of choice for like, “What\nshould I do? How should I set this up?” Whereas Zed’s a bit cleaner. It comes with a lot of\ncode syntax highlighting and code linting built in without you having to set up anything. And I only\nhad to do a couple of little tiny configuration changes to make it so that I could use the\nCircuitPython stubs with it. So yeah, it looks pretty good. Yep, it’s written in Rust, which I\nthink really contributes to the speed. I probably should have mentioned that as well. Nice. What’s\nyour next one? If you’ve been reading the Hackaday blog recently, you might have seen this article.\nI was very happy to see that my friend Leah Buechley was mentioned on Hackaday recently.\nShe’s a professor at the University of New Mexico, and for the last few years has been applying C\u0026C\nand advanced mathematical techniques to ceramics and clay, creating shapes and overhangs and angles\nand structures that I wouldn’t think possible in clay, let alone 3D printer plastic.\nThey’re using these commercially available 3D clay printers, which I didn’t know existed,\nbut they’ve augmented them with special tricks, sometimes with special algorithms to feed\nthe slicer, sometimes with special formulations of clay. And if Leah Buechley’s name is familiar,\nit’s because she’s also the creator of the LilyPad Arduino sewable electronic system\nfrom about 15 years ago, and the echoes of which, the round PCB with big pads,\nyou can see in the Circuit Playground Express boards that are very popular at Adafruit.\nSo the recent thing that she came out with, her and her team, is called Cerametal. It’s a way of\n3D printing metal on the desktop using a custom metalized clay. And once it’s printed, it’s fired\nin a kiln, and it gets centered into a solid metal part. So you just have like a standard,\nlike tiny 3D printer, you print out this clay onto a platform, and then you put that into the kiln,\nand it becomes a metal object. Like, what? So this custom metal clay is just made from metal powder,\nxanthan gum, and a few other ingredients, and you just mix it together in a literal, like,\nkitchen stand mixer. To slice the model that they want to print out, they couldn’t use a standard\nslicer like Cura, because the clay, once you start extruding it, you can’t stop. It just kind of\nkeeps coming out because of the way that the mechanical materials of the clay works. So they\nhad to create a new slicer that supports this continuous extrusion. And so it’s sort of like\nvase mode. If you’ve ever done vase mode in 3D printing, it’s sort of like that, but it will do\nfills because they want to, like, make a filled object. And the print resolution is pretty\nimpressive. They can do a 0.6 millimeter nozzle and 0.3 millimeter layer height, which is pretty\ncomparable to a standard 3D printer. The cost is around 2k. That’s for, like, basically half of\nthat is for the printer, half of that is for a kiln. And when you compare that to, like, the 50k\nto 130k for an SLS, Selective Laser Sentry Machine, that’s pretty darn cheap. And you’re doing this\nall on your desk, you know? A desk, and then you take it to a kiln. And, but one of the more\ninteresting things to me, like, so I’ll never do this because, you know, I don’t play with clay,\nbut I think it’s really fascinating that you can make metal objects now. In their slicer,\nthey use an algorithm called Fermat Spirals to fill in the spaces, because one of the\ncharacteristics of the Fermat Spiral is that it guarantees that the area between the lines\nare equal area, which is perfect for when you’re laying out a base that should be filled. I’ll\ninclude a couple of links in the show notes for some things to play with. Fermat Spirals are also\nvery pretty. They’re sort of a parabolic spiral. There’s also a great video that Leah gave for the\nACM SIGCHI conference that goes through all of this. And so I highly recommend watching the\nvideo. It’s about maybe 14 minutes long. I read the Hackaday article, and I thought it did a good\njob of explaining, you know, how you put the powder together with the clay and then fire it in the\nkiln. But one of the things that caught my eye is they said that the shrinkage is consistent,\nwhich has got to be awesome for metal parts, because then you’re getting, you know, the same\npart every time. Yeah, that’s one of the, that’s, my wife does a bunch of clay stuff, and that’s\none of the things that you’re always having to figure out is clay always shrinks when you fire\nit. But the amount of shrinkage really is based on the thickness of your piece, the tallness of the\npiece, the amount of like wetness that day of the piece. And so like, you essentially have to like\nmake a couple of trial runs to get something of a consistent dimension. And so the fact that they can\nget a very consistent output is huge. Oh, that’s interesting. I had no idea. So yeah, what’s your\nnumber two for this week? Way back in episode four, in November of 2022, we talked about Matter,\nthe open source IoT specification that’s managed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, which is a\nmouthful. If you don’t remember, don’t know of Matter, it requires a Matter controller, such as\na Google Nest device, Apple HomePod or Apple TV, or most Amazon Echo devices. And then for example,\nyou can buy a Matter supported smart light bulb and set it up with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant\nor Alexa without having to worry about what it’s compatible with. If it’s Matter compatible,\nit’ll work with them all. I’ll link to a great article from Wired Magazine on what is Matter.\nThe reason I bring it up is Scott Shawcroft, CircuitPython’s lead developer, shared in a\nrecent Python on hardware newsletter update that he’s working on an open source implementation of\nMatter called CircuitMatter. Don’t let the name fool you. It will be a pure Python implementation\nof the Matter specification that will also be compatible with CircuitPython and potentially\neven MicroPython. Jeff Epler has already implemented IPv6 networking support in CircuitPython,\nwhich Matter needs as well. This leads me to believe, and this is just a guess,\nis that Adafruit might make a Matter compatible microcontroller at some point in the future.\nThere’s already a board from SparkFun that is Matter compatible, but only with Arduino,\nnot with CircuitPython. I’ll link to that in the show notes as that came out this past January.\nNow, if you read the article from Wired on Matter that I mentioned earlier, it does mention that\nthe functionality supported by Matter is mostly pretty basic for now, limited to on/off, start/stop,\nand notifications from the device. But if you could program a microcontroller to even just do\na start/stop instead of always sending data via MQTT, for example, to take a measurement,\nI could see a number of different use cases that pop into my mind for that.\nIt’s very, very early in development, but I think it’s something I’m excited to keep an eye on.\nYeah, the Matter stuff is really interesting. With the recent talk of Swift Embedded,\nSwift’s the programming language that Apple uses for all their devices, what we should be using\nwhen we write apps for the iPhone or whatever, they recently released a bunch of Matter examples\nthat run on the ESP32-C6 dev board, which I think there’s an ESP32-C6 Adafruit product as well.\nThese are just another version of the ESP32, it’s not like a special chip,\nit’s not super expensive, it’s meant to be really low cost to go into smart light bulbs\nand things like that. I can’t wait to see more hobbyist-level things that use Matter.\nYep, exactly. And it’ll probably have to be an S3 board because it needs\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi, so that S3 is probably the base minimum.\nSo that’s our show. I mentioned the special announcements. You want to tune in for a\nspecial live episode of The Bootloader on CircuitPython Day, coming up on Friday, August 16th.\nThanks to Debra Ansell for taking time to share her experience at Teardown 2024,\nand thank you for listening.

They now use it on all their platforms and is the officially-recommended way to write apps for iPhone, iPads, Apple Watch, etc. Swift is heavily influenced by Haskell and Rust, which emphasizes type safety and functional programming, allowing the compiler to catch many bugs before the code ever runs. It was initially created by Chris Lattner, who also developed LLVM and the Clang compiler, which has been a revolution for compiled C-like languages.\nNow Apple has released Embedded Swift, a version of Swift that runs on microcontrollers. They have demos for the Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32-C6, nRF52840, and STM32.\nThese are pretty exciting, especially the Matter examples they’ve provided. (Matter being a new standard for home automatition, and part of Apple’s HomeKit API) The Swift Matter example for adding a “smart light” controllable with Siri or other home assistants is only about 60 lines long.\nhttps://www.cnx-software.com/2024/06/13/embedded-swift-esp32-c6-raspberry-pi-rp2040-stm32f7-nrf52840-microcontrollers/ https://www.hackster.io/news/apple-embeds-swift-into-hardware-125131557514 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqxbsADqDI4 Swift Embedded Examples - https://github.com/apple/swift-embedded-examples Swift Matter Examples - https://github.com/apple/swift-matter-examples/tree/main/smart-light Accessibility Matters (Paul #2) A new prototype for the Micro:bit and a new Adafruit product to help those with limited or different mobility:\nThe Micro:bit Access:bit Adafruit’s TRRS Trinkey CadQuery (Tod #2) I’ve been on a journey to move to open source tools for my engineering work. I use Fusion360 for my 3D CAD modeling. It’s pretty good but I’m always irritated after using it. CadQuery is a tool for building parametric 3D CAD models, but you do it all in text, no GUI. Similar to OpenSCAD, but its language is standard Python, available as a library. And can export STEP! Not just STL, making its output useful in engineering contexts.\nhttps://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html – good intro https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery – the main repo https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor – GUI editor, like OpenSCAD, one of the many ways to use CQ https://github.com/Wren6991/CQCAD – Luke Wren (ASIC designer at Raspberry Pi)’s collection of CQCAD parts Also similar: OpenJSCAD but also cannot export STEP And the original: OpenSCAD Justin Myers Interview Interview with Justin Myers, author of the CircuitPython ConnectionManager library\nConnectionManager ","categories":"","description":"Four Topics and an Interview","excerpt":"Four Topics and an Interview","ref":"/the-bootloader/blog/2024/07/01/four-topics-and-an-interview/","tags":"","title":"Four Topics and an Interview"},{"body":"Welcome to The Bootloader. I’m Paul Cutler.\nAnd I’m Tod Kurt. We have a special episode for you today with an interview with Justin\nMyers, the author of the CircuitPython Library Connection Manager. Before we get to that,\nthough, Paul and I each have a couple of things to share with you, each not more than a few\nminutes long. What’s your first one, Paul?\nMy first one is how to level up at CircuitPython. Professor John Gallaugher of Boston College\nrecently released two videos I wanted to share, one for how to migrate from using Mu and\nCircuitPython to using PyCharm with Teal and a video on using Circup to install and update\nCircuitPython libraries. If you’re not familiar with Professor Gallaugher, I talked to him\nway back in episode 3 of the CircuitPython Show, which I’ll link to in the show notes.\nHe teaches a class called Introduction to Physical Computing, which uses CircuitPython\nalong with microcontrollers to teach students computing concepts. He has other YouTube playlists\nworth checking out on his YouTube channel, especially if you’re newer to CircuitPython.\nI’ll link to those as well.\nBut back to his new videos. The first one is how to correctly set up PyCharm on MacOS\nto use with CircuitPython. Most of this is applicable to Linux, too, and I learned a\nfew new things. It’s a longer video at about half an hour, but the professor walks you\nthrough how to correctly configure PyCharm, and he’s using the free community edition\nin the video. Next, he covers using the new and updated CircuitPython setboard so you\nhave code completion for your microcontroller in PyCharm. That might be brand new to a lot\nof people and is definitely worth watching. From there, he covers using Teal, an open\nsource serial program that is way better than using Screen. It’s got auto-reconnect as\nits killer feature, and I think it’s pretty cool that he included Teal as the serial monitor\nin Mu is one of its key features.\nNext up is a 15-minute video on using CircUp to install CircuitPython libraries. If you’ve\nused CircuitPython, chances are you’ve downloaded the Adafruit library or the community library\nbundle, and then you have to find the right library out of hundreds. But what if you could\neasily use the command line? He walks you through how to use CircUp from the command\nline, and then for Mac OS users or for Linux users using the ZSH shell, he shows you how\nto add tab completion by updating your ZSH configuration file.\nCircUp has also been getting some love over the last few months. Shout out to Tim, aka\nFoamy Guy in the Adafruit community. He’s been doing some refactoring and adding new\nfeatures as well. I know I learned a few things, and if you use CircuitPython and you’re looking\nto level up your CircuitPython workflow, I highly recommend checking out these videos\nfrom Professor Gallaugher.\nI love CircUp. It’s sort of like, if you’ve never heard of it, it’s sort of like Pip,\nthe Python package manager, but for CircuitPython. And it hooks into the two big package repositories\nthat exist for CircuitPython, the Adafruit one and the community one. It’s so good, but\nit’s a little bit hard to set up if you’ve never done any sort of Python setup before.\nSo this video is like super handy because I get people asking me all the time, “How\ndo you install a CircuitPython library?”\nRight.\nAnd I’m like, “The answer is just use CircUp.” But then the question becomes, “Well, how\ndo you install CircUp?”\nAnd I think it’s really cool that he actually walks you through on how to update your ZSH\nshell for the tab autocompletes, because there’s hundreds of libraries, and it makes it just\nthat much easier to find the library you’re looking for.\nI really want to follow his steps on how to set up that PyCharm IDE, because I don’t really\nuse IDEs in the normal sense. I just use a text editor with code syntax highlighting.\nBut there’s so many people that have been trying to use the VS Code CircuitPython extension,\nand it’s been sort of perennially broken.\nThe people are so frustrated using it. And it looks like PyCharm is really well done.\nAnd there’s this nice now intro video on how to actually meld it with CircuitPython, which\nis a little weird because most of the times when you’re editing Python with an IDE, you’re\nediting the files sort of in a project, say.\nAnd CircuitPython is a little bit different in that the code lives on a device, and you\nedit the device.\nAnd so maybe your actual project is in a GitHub repo that lives on your computer somewhere.\nSo how do you deal with those two separate views of your code?\nAnd I think PyCharm can help you with that.\nIt can, but you’re still writing directly to the microcontroller in the way that it’s\nset up in this example.\nBecause I know I use PyCharm, and I did learn a couple of things, but there’s still a lot\nof copy-paste.\nYeah, yeah.\nBecause I commit everything to my GitHub repo, so I’m writing locally, saving it there, and\nthen copying it over to the drive as soon as I hit save, running the code.\nYeah, that’s usually how I work as well.\nBut I see all these people that try to use Mu, because it’s easy to use, but Mu’s getting\nkind of crusty.\nAnd Thonny, I don’t know, Thonny just always seems like it breaks my CircuitPython install\nwhenever I try to use it.\nSure.\nYeah, it’s too bad that Mu’s getting a little long in the tooth.\nIt’s an open source project, it needs a little love, but it’s nice to see other alternatives\nout there that are well documented.\nYeah, no doubt.\nYeah, I mean, the cool thing is that because it’s all just a text file, you can use anything\nthat can edit text files to edit your CircuitPython code.\nBut it’d be nice to have a really good IDE for those people who need IDEs.\nWhat’s your first one?\nAll right, so kind of related, Professor Gallaugher also does a lot of how to program iOS apps\nfor Apple devices.\nAnd so those are written in Swift.\nSwift is a programming language that Apple has been developing for the last 10 years.\nThey use it on all their platforms.\nIt’s the officially recommended way for writing apps for iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch, things\nlike that.\nAnd Swift is a really interesting language.\nIt’s heavily influenced by Haskell and Rust, these sort of academic languages that emphasize\ntype safety and functional programming, where the compiler itself can catch a lot of bugs\nas it compiles your code down, which is kind of foreign to how Python and JavaScript work,\nwhere you just kind of run your code and see if it crashes or not.\nAnd so there’s this whole academic effort in computer science that we should be able\nto make provably correct programs, or programs that we can prove will not crash for certain\nclasses of crashes.\nThat’s what Haskell and Rust kind of comes from.\nThat’s where Swift came from as well.\nAnd it’s a really interesting language.\nIt looks a little bit like C, but with all these sort of extra neat things on top of\nit.\nIf you look at Chris Lattner, who developed LLVM and the Clang compiler, which you’ve\nprobably seen in various places when you’ve installed things, it’s been the sort of revolution\nhow to compile C-based or C-like languages.\nAnd so you’ll see, I think you’ll see LLVM and Clang a lot more going forward.\nBut Swift uses those two things underneath to do its magic as well.\nAnd the reason why I’m bringing all this up is because Apple just released something they\ncall Embedded Swift, which is a version of Swift that runs on microcontrollers, which\nis amazing.\nThis is a super high-level language, in many ways higher level than Python or JavaScript.\nAnd we can run it on a microcontroller on things that are even some ways smaller than\nwhat CircuitPython type controllers can do.\nAnd not only did they release here’s Embedded Swift, but they also released working demos\nfor the Raspberry Pi Pico, the ESP32C6, the InterF52-840, which is a Beely chip, and the\nSTM32 chips.\nAnd they’ve also released a bunch of examples on how to participate in Matter, a Matter\nnetwork, which is the new standard for home automation that Apple’s HomeKit API does.\nAnd I think Google’s Echo platform also does now.\nAnd so there’s a, and it’s all on GitHub, you can just go to their Swift Matter examples,\nsee the smart light example that you can run and control.\nYou can make a controllable smart light with Siri and about 60 lines of Swift code.\nAnd it’s all, it has a lot of the same features of real Swift of the type safety, the functional\nprogramming, that kind of stuff.\nAnd it’s just sort of amazing that we’re getting this super high-level language running on\ntiny chips.\nAnd I’ve not looked at it too much yet, but in the show notes, there’ll be some links\nto some other articles describing it and links to the GitHub that has some examples.\nSo you can actually try some of this stuff out on your Pico or ESP32.\nI only know Python, and this has me really intrigued, especially the Matter integration,\nright?\nWe don’t have that in CircuitPython yet.\nI don’t think Arduino has Matter integration that I’ve seen.\nSo actually being able to write my own smart home apps on microcontrollers would be a really\ncool use case and actually has me thinking of learning a second language.\nYeah, it’s like, supposedly there’s Matter APIs in the latest ESP IDF, the SDK that you\nuse when you’re writing C code for the ESP32 chips.\nAnd I think that’s what these Swift Matter examples are using under the hood.\nBut do you really want to be mucking around with C code when you could use a high-level\nlanguage like Swift?\nYeah.\nAnd so, you know, it’d be nice if we get Matter support in CircuitPython someday.\nThere’s no reason why we can’t.\nAnd I think Jeffler might actually be working on that really, really early stages.\nNice.\nYeah, yeah.\nI would love to see that.\nAll right, Paul, what’s your number two?\nMy number two is accessibility matters.\nWhen I first started contributing to open source about 20 years ago, one of the first\nprojects I contributed to was the GNOME project, the Linux desktop environment.\nOne of the core pieces of GNOME’s culture is accessibility, which includes everything\nfrom the Orca screen reader to how we wrote documentation back then.\nYou know, the worst disability that I have personally is being extremely colorblind,\nbut that focus on accessibility has always stuck with me, which is why I’m excited to\nsee a project like this.\nThe first is the AccessBit from Dr. John Vidler in the UK.\nThe Micro:bit Educational Foundation commissioned a report on accessibility, which included\na speculative section on how to improve the Micro:bit platform for those with limited or\ndifferent mobility.\nIf you’re not familiar with the Micro:bit, it’s a microcontroller primarily made for\neducation, popular in the UK and Australia, that features two buttons, a 5x5 LED grid,\nand connections for alligator clips.\nIt can run MicroPython, CircuitPython, and MakeCode.\nThe report included a few sketches and possible solutions for potential 3.5 millimeter audio\njacks, which are the industry de facto standard for accessibility, like what are found on\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Adaptive Controller.\nDr. Vidler decided to design a PCB as a minimum viable product to add five adaptive switches.\nHe walks through various iterations of his design, landing on a final design that includes\nan edge connector to connect to the Micro:bit and room for five 3.5 millimeter jacks.\nIt’s pretty cool the thought that he put into the design, from how the add-on board connects\nusing the 40 pin Micro:bit controller to the curved design of the board.\nHe had JLCPCB make a handful of boards and sent them off, and they were shown at the\nBlockly Summit in Cambridge earlier in June.\nCheck out the show notes to the link to his blog post detailing the process, including\nphotos.\nThe second product is a new Adafruit product, the TRRS Trinkey.\nAdafruit’s Trinkey line includes a USB-A port to plug it into a host computer, and a small\nboard maybe the size of a flash drive, so it’s pretty small.\nThe TRRS Trinkey has a SAMD21 chip, has one 3.5 millimeter jack, and can run CircuitPython\nor Arduino.\nI think it’s great that those who might need it have more options for accessibility, especially\nusing microcontrollers, which they can program to their needs.\nI’m excited to see what people can think up using tech like this, especially if it makes\ntheir lives easier.\nThese are a great sort of combo, because the Adafruit TRRS Trinkey is purely just a USB device.\nIt looks like a little USB thumb drive almost, it just has a 3.5 millimeter jack on the back.\nBut the Micro:bit, it has Bluetooth.\nIt has USB as well, but it has Bluetooth.\nAnd so you can now make a Bluetooth accessible controller with this little add-on board by\njust snicking the Micro:bit into it, and then plugging in some of these accessibility controllers\ninto that, and then pairing it with your phone with a little bit of code, with make code\nor something.\nThat’s incredible.\nI think there’ll be a lot of fun things being created with this.\nI agree.\nWhat’s your next one?\nSo my next one is about CAD query.\nSo I’ve been on a journey to move to open source tools for my engineering work.\nI’ve mentioned before I’ve gone from using Eagle to KiCAD.\nI use Fusion 360 for my 3D CAD modeling, and it’s pretty good, but I’m always irritated\nafter using it for a lot of different reasons.\nWhat are the open source alternatives?\nIf you’re going for a gooey 3D experience, there’s things like Blender, but I like parametric\nmodeling.\nOne of the nice things that Fusion 360 does is you can make everything parametric, where\nyou just define a set of constraints, and then you create solid bodies from those constraints.\nBlender’s not really that.\nBlender’s more of like an artist’s tool.\nIt can do a little bit of it.\nSo for the longest time, there’s been this thing called OpenSCAD, which is a textual\n3D parametric modeler.\nAnd it’s a gooey app where you’ve got two panes.\nOne pane is the text of the OpenSCAD language you write to create cubes and pyramids and\ncones and ways to combine them in different ways to make your 3D object.\nAnd then on the right is a render of what that thing looks like.\nAnd so from that, you can, and people have done this to great effect, make enclosures\nand other 3D things that can be 3D printed.\nLike I think all of the Prusa components in the Prusa 3D printers are all actual SCAD\nmodels that somebody has designed as text files.\nAnd so if you need to make the screw holes a little bigger because you’re building it\nby hand and you’re 3D printing the pieces and you only have M5 screws instead of M3\nscrews, you can maybe just go into the OpenSCAD file and change one little parameter and change\nall the screw hole sizes.\nBut I’ve always bristled at OpenSCAD because it’s got its own special language.\nAnd I’ve been looking at other things.\nAnd I just discovered recently this thing that’s been around for a long time called\nCAD Query, which is like OpenSCAD, but it’s all in Python.\nIt uses standard Python syntax, and it is mostly a library that you can then express\nvia various ways.\nYou can just run a main.py and have that output a file, but you can also run this thing called\nCQ Editor, which is a GUI editor, kind of like the OpenSCAD editor where you have multiple\nwindows and you can edit text in one and see a render in the other window.\nAnd I’ve been using that and it’s kind of working.\nI don’t know, even though I’ve been using CircuitPython for so many years, I’m still\nnot a very good Python person.\nSo this is like kind of diving into more Python.\nThe reason why I discovered this is Luke Wren, who is one of the ASIC designers, sorry, at\nRaspberry Pi.\nHe’s one who has helped us do some of the clever PIO things that we’ve done with the\nRaspberry Pi RP2040 chip, like the cool SynthIO and PWM and touch sensors and stuff is all\nkind of because, oh, and most especially the HDMI output from a little $4 microcontroller\nis because of some of his hints that he’s given us.\nBut he has a GitHub repo of a bunch of CAD query files.\nSo if you want to see how CAD query things look, what the Python looks like, you can\njust go to his repository and go, oh, look, there’s a little vacuum adapter and here’s\nan air duct plate or whatever.\nSo there’s a nice little library of things for you to kind of browse through and see\nwhat CAD query feels like from a language point of view.\nBut one of the best things about CAD query is that unlike OpenSCAD and unlike the similar\nOpenJS CAD, which is the same thing as OpenSCAD in some ways, but with JavaScript, CAD query\noutputs step files, which are object files, not STLs, which are like tessellated, triangulated\nshapes.\nAnd I was really frustrated that like OpenSCAD doesn’t have a step export feature because\nif you have a step file, you can now import that into another CAD program like Fusion\n360 and then do additional edits on it.\nWhereas it’s really hard to do edits on meshes.\nThe STL format is made for just output, for 3D printing.\nIt’s like the bitmap version of your vector file.\nAnd so having a step is really important to me.\nAnd so, yeah, so I’m going to be playing with CAD query over the next whatever months or\nso and see if I do anything with it.\nI share your excitement for that.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Python is the only language I know.\nSo looking through some of those examples, it’s started to click for me.\nI’ve tried to use OpenSCAD and never could figure it out.\nI can’t use FreeCAD because they don’t have a colorblind mode and Fusion 360, I’ve never\nreally gotten the hang of.\nI’ve had some luck with Onshape, but actually having the ability to actually program it\nis and with the examples that they’ve got, looks really cool.\nThanks, Tod.\nAnd now we have a special guest, Justin Myers.\nBack in episode seven for the CircuitPython 9 release show we did, I mentioned Connection\nManager, but kind of guessed how it worked.\nWell, I reached out to the author of the new library, Justin Myers, and asked him about\nit.\nHere’s the interview.\nJustin, welcome to the show.\nThanks, Paul.\nI’m excited to be here.\nTo be honest, it’s my first time I’ve been on a podcast, so I’m really excited about\nit.\nIt’s great that you’re here.\nWhat is the new CircuitPython library Connection Manager and what was your inspiration in creating\nit?\nYeah, so basically late 2023, I had decided to spend some of my, let’s call it extra time\nworking on CircuitPython and trying to see how I could help project.\nI love the open source community.\nAnd as I was kind of watching the threads, I just saw kind of user after user on Discord\nhaving different connection issues, running out of sockets, different things like that,\nmemories issues and everything.\nAnd I was like, “Hmm, seems strange.\nShould be a better way.”\nAnd so as I kind of started digging in, saw like each library kind of managed sockets\ndifferently and really think about and look at the differences between like a microcontroller\nand CPython running on a PC is like on CPython, you can open sockets all day long, nothing\nreally happens.\nBut then once you get to a microcontroller, it’s different.\nAnd kind of once I started digging into that, I was like, “Oh, well, you’ve got the native\nWi-Fi that does it one way.\nYou’ve got like the ESP32 SPI that does it one way.\nYou’ve got the WISNET 5K that does it a different way.”\nAnd just kind of all this boilerplate and different ways to get the SSL connection and\ndifferent things.\nAnd I was like, “This is weird.\nLike there should be an easier way to do this.”\nAnd so it’s kind of what started me going down this road of trying to find out like,\n“Is there a better way to do this?”\nAnd what was the better way?\nSo basically kind of the flow went, I asked the comment on the CircuitPython dev channel\nand Discord.\nI said, “Hey, I’ve got this idea.”\nBasically the requests library had this built-in session manager that kind of managed a bunch\nof the sockets.\nBut oftentimes what users would do is they would just re-init that thing and lose all\nthe sockets.\nAnd so they were still technically open, just sitting there.\nAnd so kind of that first pass was I basically kind of separated some of that out to a separate\nclass and kind of shared that with the devs.\nAnd they were like, “Nope, let’s create a new library.\nLike that’s not a good way to do it.”\nKind of break up dependencies and everything like that.\nAnd kind of from that, there’s literally days spent kind of back and forth on like, “What\nshould we name this?”\nAnd so ConnectionManager was kind of where that was born and basically just started separating\na bunch of the stuff out of what was in the request library and put it into this new one.\nAnd then building handlers that would take in whatever radio object you passed in and\ntry to determine, “Oh, what’s the right SSL method for this one?”\nReducing imports from five or six all the way down to just the one or two that were\nneeded.\nAnd that’s really the key, isn’t it?\nIf you have a PicoW, it was doing it different than an ESP32 S3.\nAnd now for the user, that setup instantiation is almost the same across the different microcontrollers.\nIs that right?\nYeah.\nAnd that was kind of the goal, right?\nBecause if you think through how CircuitPython started and once connection happened, so the\nESP32 Spy was one of the first ones, developers wrote that library and then they kind of mimicked\nit a little bit for the Wiznet 5K.\nAnd then when the new ones came out, like ESP32 S2 and S3 and things, and they started\nhaving this onboard wifi, they changed how they did it again.\nAnd with anything that’s open source, they’re running forward as fast as they can.\nAnd sometimes it’s hard to go backwards to go update everything.\nThere were depreciation flags and comments, not flags in the code.\nAnd all of these places were like, “Oh, we should get rid of this at some point,” but\nit was still there like years or months later.\nAnd so a lot of it was like trying to trim some of that down.\nWhat was it like to partner with the core developers on Connection Manager?\nI really enjoyed it.\nIt was really interesting.\nIt’s been a really interesting progress for me.\nSo a lot of my development started in C, 20 plus years ago when I started doing dev.\nAnd a lot of it was for smaller systems.\nAnd it was at a time where you had to do memory management and really think of your code for\nwhat’s going to be the fastest and most efficient ways.\nAnd last 20 years, I’ve switched over to things like Python and things where…\nAnd JavaScript and everything, where a lot of that stuff’s just handled for you and you\nforget about it.\nAnd so it’s actually been really fun because they’ll make comments on PRs and they’re like,\n“Oh yeah, that’s a wasteful way to do something,” because there’s not a lot of space.\nSo it’s really small and trying to think through it.\nBut they’ve been great.\nThere’s been times where a handful of them, we’ve jumped on calls together to work through\nsome things and figure it out.\nThey’ve been great on the comments and asking questions and whatnot.\nAnd so I think the CircuitPython devs, it’s a great team to work with.\nWell, that’s great to hear.\nWhat’s next for you and Connection Manager?\nKind of where I’ve been going next, I’ve been opening a handful of PRs to make the radios\nagain more similar.\nSo for example, they all had different ways to find out what AP am I connected to?\nWhat’s my Mac address?\nAnd different methods of returning everything.\nSo I’ve been continuously working to try to get the different radios as close to the same\nas possible.\nAnd so really for an idea of…\nA typical user probably goes out and they buy a microcontroller that’s got whatever\nWi-Fi has on it, and they go run with that project and go.\nBut oftentimes they see a lot of the questions are someone sees a learn guide and they’re\nlike, “Well, I don’t have that stuff that’s in the learn guide.\nI have this.”\nBut then they really struggle to try to figure out how to get it all to work because these\ndifferent methods are different.\nSo it’s really been working to get all those core methods the same.\nSo you can, for the most part, copy paste other than initializing the radio itself.\nAnd the work I’m doing currently now is I’m actually building out some network test code\nthat we can run.\nAnd so every time a new version of requests comes out or 9.1 for CircuitPython or 9.2\nor 10 or whatnot, we can actually run the same test code across the same different microcontrollers\nand actually figure out like, “Oh, is SSL still working?\nCan I still connect to MQTT?\nCan I run a server?\nCan I do requests?”\nAnd ideally with a goal of having a kind of similar to CSS is that this like, “Can I use?”\nLike so you could go look and be like, “I have this microcontroller.\nI’m using this radio and I want to do this.\nCan I do that?”\nWell, that’s great.\nIt’s been fun and exciting to watch you partner with the core devs as you’ve built this over\nthe last few months.\nThank you so much for being on the show.\nThank you very much.\nI really appreciate it.\nAnd that’s our show.\nA special thanks to Justin Myers.\nIf you enjoy listening to the show, tell a friend or write a review.\nIt really does help.\nFor detailed show notes and transcripts, visit

episode 9 and the show works like this.\nTod and I have each brought three things to share.\nWe’ll chat about each for a few minutes but no more than five.\nIf you want to learn more visit the detailed show notes at thebootloader.net.\nTod what’s your first one?\nAlright so I’m gonna start it off really nerdy.\nYou know I like the little tiny microcontroller boards that do various fun things and I just discovered one a couple weeks ago called the M5 Stack Cardputer.\nLike computer but card.\nIt’s about the size of a deck of playing cards and it’s got an ESP32-S3 chip in it which means it does Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nIt’s got a little screen a little keyboard and it’s all in a little case.\nSo it’s almost like a little consumer electronics product.\nIt’s pretty well designed our industrial design wise but it’s got a full QWERTY keyboard in something the size of a deck of cards.\nSo the buttons are very small especially for my big old meat meaty mitts but they work.\nAnd so it’s it’s it’s a pretty useful little device just right there just with those features just with the screen keyboard and having Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nBut it’s also got a microphone and an I2S amplifier to a speaker.\nIt’s got a microSD slot.\nIt’s got infrared I think both to receive and send.\nAnd then it’s also got a 1400 milliamp hour battery so it can just be this like you know portable thing you can have in your bag to play with all the time.\nAnd on top of all this it’s only $30.\nSo I got a couple couple weeks ago been playing around with it.\nThe little app that comes with it is actually remarkably full featured.\nIt’s like a little almost tiny little OS you to choose from different little apps.\nThere’s a pretend your Bluetooth keyboard pretend your Wi-Fi keyboard.\nThere’s you know scan your Wi-Fi.\nThere’s a full Python REPL.\nYou can just like start and then start doing MicroPython.\nA bunch of other stuff and of course that all that code is available so you can download and look at it and everything else.\nBut because it’s ESP32-S3 it works with all the other software that we’ve been using in Arduino and CircuitPython all these years.\nLike there’s a CircuitPython build for it which you can just run it and it sets up the display and all the keys and stuff for you.\nSo you can just like start going or going doing CircuitPython stuff with it.\nWhile it is a Chinese based company M5Stack makes all these interesting little sort of pluggable computer things.\nThey’re sort of like the QDPI in size but they have a much higher density pinout because they’re made to be plugged into into PCBs rather than plugged into a breadboard.\nBut you can get them shipped from the US from electromaker.io.\nAnd so I got a couple I’ve been playing around with them.\nI’m a big fan of the ESP32-S3 chipset because it can do Wi-Fi and it’s very fast.\nIt’s good for doing synthesizer stuff.\nSo I’ve been doing a little synthesizer experiments on it because hey it’s got that speaker output that’s hooked up to an I2S audio DAC.\nAnd yeah it’s a I think if someone wants to have something to play with that’s really tiny and you can just kind of kind of you know hide it in your bag.\nI say it’s a good $30 well spent.\nI’ve been following along with some of the pull requests to get that up and running with CircuitPython.\nI didn’t realize it was only 30 bucks.\nYeah.\nThat’s amazing how much functionality comes for that price.\nYeah I mean especially because it’s got this full multi-piece injection molded enclosure with a bunch of buttons and stuff.\nIt’s like you know just the injection molding of that is pretty expensive and so they it seems like they approached it as almost a consumer product.\nLike how much consumer productness can we fit with a retail price of $30 and using ESP32 and they just went from there.\nWhat comes pre-loaded on it?\nIs it MicroPython?\nIt’s an Arduino sketch.\nI think that somehow is embedding MicroPython.\nI need to look into it more.\nI unfortunately blew it away because I was playing around with CircuitPython stuff.\nBut on my to-do list is to read I think I found the code that came on it.\nI want to like recompile it and reload it and see if I can get it and see what actually going on because it was amazing what it did.\nIt had these little apps and you go back back to the main app launching screen.\nIt’s kind of surprising how good it was.\nYou’ll have to give us an update next episode.\nYeah totally.\nAlright so what’s your number one for this week?\nMy first one is RadioFreeFedi and I’m all in on the Fediverse.\nI really enjoy using Mastodon for social media, PixelFed for sharing photos usually of which records I’m playing, and then there’s RadioFreeFedi.\nLongtime listeners know I’m really into music and I have to give a shout out to Axwax on Mastodon for introducing me to RadioFreeFedi.\nAxel if you’re listening, thank you.\nRadioFreeFedi is an online music stream dedicated to independent artists on the Fediverse.\nIt turns out there’s a whole world of artists making music on the Fediverse in every genre.\nIf you visit RadioFreeFedi.net you will find three channels you can listen to.\nThe first is the main channel.\nYou’ll hear songs from almost every genre and as the website says some of the songs will challenge you with music you may not normally listen to but it is curated and if you don’t like a song another one will be on in just a few minutes.\nThe second channel is called Comfy which smooths out the edges for those who might want a softer experience.\nThis is my go-to channel in the mornings when I want something a little quieter than the main channel.\nAnd then there’s a specialty channel which hosts a block of songs around a theme which changes every hour.\nThey also at the top and bottom of the hour have a little spoken word section.\nSometimes this could be a poem but it’s really it’s a really neat feature that they break up the music with with spoken words and people can actually volunteer to read station IDs as well.\nI need to work up the courage and volunteer to do that because I really enjoy RadioFreeFedi.\nThat sounds fun yeah.\nIf I was smart I would have mentioned RadioFreeFedi on the last episode because in May they host FediVision which just wrapped up.\nIt’s a take on Eurovision where Feddy artists submit songs from fictitious countries and listeners can vote on their favorite songs.\nIt was really fun listening to all the entries on the special channel that RadioFreeFedi set up to stream those songs.\nGoing back to my shout out to Axwax who tirelessly promotes musicians on the Fediverse especially on Bandcamp Friday and Faircamp Friday.\nIf you haven’t heard of that Bandcamp used to host Bandcamp Fridays where 100% of the music proceeds would go to the artists and none of the fees went to Bandcamp.\nAnd it started during the pandemic as a way to help boost those artists revenue streams because they couldn’t tour for example.\nYeah well Bandcamp’s been sold twice in the last few years and an alternative open source solution has popped up called Faircamp.\nMusicians can install Faircamp pointed at a directory of songs and it will create a static website you can host to stream the songs and it integrates with payment processors like Stripe so you can offer purchases to your listeners as well.\nIf you enjoy music and if you enjoy being on the Fediverse I strongly encourage you to check out RadioFreeFedi.\nThere’s links in the show notes to some of the artists I’ve discovered that I like and if you like RadioFreeFedi check out their state of the station on how they’re doing and how to support them.\nRunning an online radio station isn’t cheap and if you come across an artist you like share it on the Fediverse and let others know.\nThat’s really cool I really like the Faircamp thing because I mean it’s a static site generator geared towards making playlists that you can listen to stream audio online from various websites.\nThat seems to be one of the places where the static site generators I’ve seen kind of fall down they don’t really have a way of serving up mp3s or whatever and so yeah that’s pretty cool.\nI’m a big fan of online streaming radio stations I’ve been a big supporter of Soma FM but they’re like more traditional like real quote unquote real musicians that have record deals and such.\nI really like the “hey let’s all listen to each other’s stuff” because it’s so nice and easy to make your own music now.\nYeah and Faircamp’s really neat if you don’t have cover art it’s got a generative AI built in so it’ll create cover art for you.\nThat’s hilarious.\nYeah what’s your next one?\nAll right so I build a lot of little circuits I make PCBs to house those circuits or to be the infrastructure for those circuits and for about 20 years I’ve used this program called Eagle to design those PCBs.\nIt was a okay program it’s gone through multiple users sorry multiple owners over that 20 year period the latest of which is Autodesk and Autodesk initially improved it a lot but in the last several years like last four years or whatever they’ve kind of abandoned it and they’ve officially said in 2026 they’re going to stop supporting Eagle at all which is frustrating because one of the last changes they made was you had to log into the Autodesk authentication servers to use the program which I assume means in 2026 I won’t even be able to open up Eagle anymore.\nSo it’s been on my to-do list to shift to this open source schematic program called KiCad or KiCad.\nI think KiCad is the appropriate way to pronounce it but I always pronounce it KiCad because I’m American I guess and earlier earlier this year I finally made the jump and I decided that for my next circuit board I’m going to design it in KiCad KiCad and for every circuit board after that I’m going to try to do it in KiCad.\nLooking around there’s lots of instructional material on it which is on KiCad which is great but it’s been around for a long time and it’s been evolving and getting so much easier to use than it has than it was just a few years ago and so it’s like well what which videos should you watch and also for me I’m kind of this immigrant from from Eagle like which one is more appropriate to me because I know the concepts of how to do schematics I just don’t know the particulars and so I found this one really great YouTube channel called Plum Pot.\nPlum Pot is a couple it’s um Carrie Plumstead and JP Potgieter so Plum Pot they had this really great long playlist of YouTube videos that’s how to go from installing KiCad to creating the symbols in the schematic and the footprints on the PCB and to ordering those PCBs with generating the Gerber files that the PCB house needs and while it is an older series it was done with KiCad 5 almost everything they’ve talked that they talk about is relevant especially some of the more advanced topics which hasn’t really changed much like in the last several several versions of KiCad they have made the UI a lot easier to to work with at least to me when I like back when I tried this a couple years ago I found I found KiCad kind of weird and this is someone who has used Eagle for so many years which has the weirdest UI but but in the last several years it seems like the usability has has just gone over a hill where it’s just everything is so much simpler and that’s been really great so I was able to do some of the like just getting started stuff much easier than I could before but some of these tricky things I couldn’t quite get going and watching the PlumPot videos really helped thank you to Kerry Plumstead and JP Pottinger for helping me get over the hump of getting into KiCad and I’m full full-time KiCad person now what’s been the most challenging part of the transition from Eagle to KiCad for you so I think the main thing is in Eagle when you so in circus you have you have a part like say a a knob a potentiometer and you have two different representations of that part you have the schematic symbol that’s the sort of semantic how the pot is wired up to your circuit and then you have the physical layout of that pot solder footprint which is somewhere on your PCB like physically like it’s three inches over and two inches down and it’s rotated 90 degrees and all that kind of stuff and in Eagle those two representations these sort of semantic schematic representation and the physical layout footprint specification are joined together and that makes it it’s very it’s a very logical way of thinking about it in some ways because you’re like oh yeah I just want to plop down this exact pot the downside with the Eagle format is that there are literally tens of thousands of different kinds of potentiometer so you have this you have this one single symbol in the schematic but you have 10 the 10,000 different variations in your circuit board in the in the physical reality of it you know is it a horizontal potentiometer that sticks out towards kind of towards you or does it a vertical potentiometer that sticks up it is a six millimeter or nine millimeter potentiometer it’s like there’s all these different variations and so if Eagle you could run into the problem where you have in your schematic the choice of like well which several hundred of those did these different same looking symbols am I going to use and whereas KiCad it’s totally separate you have just the potentiometer symbol that you use when you’re drawing schematics and then at some point later you have to you have to go through this process of assigning the footprints where you say this part needs that exact footprint and in retrospect now that makes a lot of sense but at the time I was like how do I take my schematic and turn it into the actual PCB it was like it just seemed like it didn’t make much sense to me that was like the biggest hurdle for me was getting over this binding of the schematic to the PCB footprint part problem that that Eagle kind of solves invisibly for you.\nHas there been something that surprised you on how easy it was to do in KiCad?\nOh yeah the 3d visualization so when you’re laying out a circuit board and you’re like putting down like a switch and a knob and a display and like the some micro controller board it’s kind of hard to tell how how that will actually look and so like what are the things one would do to visualize that that is one of the things I used to do is I would print out on paper a one-to-one representation of that circuit board and then I would lay parts on top of it to sort of feel kind of how the parts are interacting because because you’re looking at a 2d representation just a flat sort of vector art view of what the PCB looks like but real parts have 3d height and they kind of overlap a little bit sometimes they have overhangs sometimes when you need to place a part your fingers have to go on each side of it so there needs to be room on each side of the part so your fingers can actually push the part in things like that and so it was really hard it’s like okay well I’ll print it out on paper and I’ll lay the parts out like a little scale model or what I was doing in Eagle is I was exporting a version of it into fusion 360 which is a 3d CAD program and finding 3d representations for close enough analogs to the parts I was going to use and plopping them onto this this 3d model and then looking to the 3d model in KiCad keycad you can just press option f3 or something and it will generate a 3d model for you right there so you can just immediately go what does this look like and you just see what it looks like you go oh okay it’s actually these two these parts that you close together I’ll never get be able to get my fingers in between there and so you can just start nudging nudging it and so being able to just really quickly see the visual 3d representation of the board is so cool very cool anyway yeah KiCad very awesome so so Paul what’s your number two my number two is André Costa and the Pico W air so continuing on that meet the maker thing I started last episode I wanted to share a cool product by André the Pico W air André is more well known for being the creator of RPI locator a website and mastodon bot that alerts you in a Raspberry Pi becomes available for sale online he was recently in magpie magazine who did a great story on him and RPI locator I’ll link to that in the show notes but he’s also created the Pico W air a wireless air quality monitor powered by CircuitPython and CircuitPythons HTTP server I don’t think I’ve seen another product for sale that actually uses CircuitPythons HTTP server and for just under 13 bucks you get a custom PCB with a Pico W mounted to it with a connector for a particulate matter sensor and a quick connector for additional sensors like the recommended temperature and humidity sensor for example he also has a particulate matter sensor available as an add-on for sale on his Tindie store so you could actually bundle them both together what I think is innovative is not only does it have MQTT but it takes advantage of HTTP server just add your Wi-Fi settings in the settings that Tomo like you would do in a normal CircuitPython microcontroller find the IP of the device and you can connect to it from your phone or from another computer and you can view all the stats right there in a web browser nicely formatted so you can see it what’s your air quality what’s the temperature what’s the humidity if you have added those sensors for example and since it works with MQTT it’s easy to add to home assistant as well it also has a JSON API so you can interact with it through the API too.\nI talked about the micro dot web server last episode in the fact that MicroPython has over a dozen different web servers CircuitPython has just this one and I think this is a really interesting use case for it yeah totally I really like how he supports multiple ways of looking at the data like over the net like he’s got MQTT HTML and JSON API like that’s like normally in these CircuitPython projects you kind of see these really stripped down examples of how to do one aspect of that but he’s developed a full application that kind of offers all the things you want to have when you have something like a sensor like this exactly it’s a really neat product and I’ll make sure I link to his Tindie store and to follow him on Mastodon in the show notes as well\nYeah I’m looking at it right now and it’s great because the whole PCB with the Pico mounted is like basically the size of you know it fits in your hand and the look the sensor is basically the same size so it’s made to go just right on top of the sensor that’s great yep\nWhat’s your next one?\nThis is another YouTube thing this is so there’s this game designer named Freya Holmér and she makes I think I think mostly her job like her job she does for money is she designs tools and shaders for unity which is a 3d game engine and but one of the things that I mostly know her from are these beautiful YouTube videos that she makes about algorithms the reason why this came up recently is because just a day or two ago she released a talk that she gave called lerp smoothing is broken and lerp is a is the sort of gaming term for linear interpolation it’s when you have it reaches it reaches destination in a smooth fashion rather than abruptly so it feels more realistic you might you might you might hear easing as a nether way of doing that but easing is more fixed in the way it approaches its destination whereas lerp is kind of responsive to the changes in the destination the reason why this perked up my ears is because the the equation for lerp is very similar to the technique I use to smooth sensor inputs like knob inputs called exponential smoothing or basically you take the last value and multiply it fractionally plus the new value of your pot reading say and you combine them together to give you a smoother thing and both of these techniques both lerp and exponential smoothing suffer from the problem of they change how they look with the frame rate changing because the way it works is you multiply a percent of the old value add it to a percent of the new value if you’re reading the new for exponential smoothing if we’re reading that value a lot your resulting smooth value kind of matches too quickly your red value so the filtering doesn’t look as good so you kind of want to slow that down and similarly in lerp if you if your frame rate is lower the object appears to move slower because it’s not being updated as frequently and so so she talks about and this video is great because it talks about some frame rate independent techniques for dealing with changeable frame rate like in in her case because she’s a game person she’s like well you know some people might be what playing this game at a cinematic 20 frame 24 frames per second but some person might might have a high-end gaming rig that’s had 120 games 20 hundred 120 frames per second and those two people will have two very different experiences because the lerp will be essentially five times slower on the on the slower frames per second person’s computer and the video before that that I was I was most enamored with was this one called the beauty of bezier curves and I don’t know i’m sure everyone has has used a graphics program like illustrator and they’ve tried to use the bezier design tool and it’s always been a little bit mystifying to me about how the heck it’s supposed to work like i just want the curve to kind of look like this how am I supposed to do that with these control points or whatever and this like almost hour-long video talks about the math behind bezier curves and explains what’s going on and gives you a sort of intuition as to what’s happening with those control points and why why you would put them where you’d want to put them and so it’s i don’t know I i plus her animations she does for the for these videos are just spot on so so wonderful looking so I say put this on you might learn some things if not it’s really cool to look at yeah it’s on my list to watch I didn’t get a chance to watch it before we recorded but it sounds really neat especially the bezier curves one because as you said that’s just a mystery on how that works totally and then one last one last video is if you’re doing anything in uh say CircuitPython Arduino with any type of little video game you want to make or any sort of little generative art you almost will always be using vectors you know vectors are really just two numbers like usually x comma y that you use to represent a position in space or maybe a direction in space and you usually want to combine vectors like if you’re a spaceship spaceship has a velocity and when you push the go button you’ve got a thrust acceleration vector that needs to be added to your spaceship’s velocity vector how do you do that and so there are many different ways to multiply vectors some of them give you interesting information like how close the vectors are pointing towards each other other ones would be like how to just scale a vector the other is uh how to tell like together what direction the two vectors are sort of pointing right angles to so like you if you have an x and y if you look at them in a certain way and multiplying a certain way it’ll tell you which way is z which which is really handy and so she goes into this really really great discussion as to how to think about the many different ways you can multiply vectors because it’s not a straightforward thing just as multiplying two numbers\nAnd you used it in a game i understand?\nIf I would have watched her video I might have been able to write my little arcade game called CircuitPython starroids um a little faster because a lot of this vector stuff i learned way back in college and kind of forgot because you know when I was doing web stuff you don’t really use these sort of game vectors right.\nokay paul what’s your number three?\nMy last one is the CircuitPython online ide so as folks who use CircuitPython know there’s a number of ways you can program your microcontroller and CircuitPython most folks just plug it into usb and use a text editor to do it but you can program it over bluetooth there’s now the web workflow where you can do it wirelessly and there’s also code.circuitpython.org where you can use a chrome based browser and program it right there in your browser River Wang has also created an online editor for CircuitPython which i’ve linked to in the show notes it has some really innovative features and if someone was going to ask which online editor they should use this is the one i’d pick over the one that Adafruit developed when you first load the web page it has three steps for you to connect making it super easy to understand you install CircuitPython on your microcontroller if you haven’t done that already open the CIRCUITPY drive and then connect to the serial port that’s it it also has a nice youtube video embedded with a quick start guide for additional help if you need it once you’re connected there’s a folder view on the left that lists all the files on your microcontroller that’s something that code.circuitpython.org doesn’t have so you can edit your settings at toeml you can edit your code.py you just double click to edit it and the file opens right there in your browser the serial console is on the right making it really easy to see if you have any errors in your code or what’s going on behind the scenes a couple of things that set it apart is that it has tabs so you can have multiple files open right in your browser it has easy access to control d and control c as buttons so if you want to stop or restart the program it’s just click of a button in your browser and it also has a plotter function similar to Mu though you have to add some code to make the plotter work but it has a good example to get you started I think that’s pretty cool because a lot of people graduate fromMuto a text editor that no text editor that i’ve seen other than Mu has that plotter built in the other thing I think is just awesome is I love seeing community members create projects like this it shows the growing community around CircuitPython and you don’t always have to rely on Adafruit for everything I especially like how River is driving innovation by using the browser to write your code another interesting use case might be hosting your own server I can see a classroom environment doing that especially with Mu not getting a lot of love the last couple of years there hasn’t been a moo release in almost two years a couple of the bugs are starting to surface but if you’re interested check out the links in the show notes to the online ide and give it a try yeah it’s it’s I i follow river on mastodon and i’m really impressed whenever they make up an update to it because it just keeps getting better and better.\nI didn’t know about the plotter function that’s one of the things I really miss about the Adafruit sorry the Adafruit the Arduino ide is it’s got a really good serial plotter it’s kind of a hidden like special feature special uh yeah special feature of the app and sometimes I will actually open up Arduino just to run the serial plotter for a CircuitPython sketch just so I can get the really good plotter but uh but that’s really troublesome because Arduino likes to sort of try to connect to the serial port when you’re when you’re trying to use it so it’s be nice to have it all in one thing yeah\nI agree.\nWell that’s our show, for detailed show notes visit thebootloader.net you can follow Tod and I on Mastodon check out thebootloader.net for links to that as well and we will see you next episode.\nStay positive!\n","categories":"","description":"Episode 9 Transcript - Beautiful Bezier Curves","excerpt":"Episode 9

In episode 8, Paul and Tod discuss learn to solder kits from Carrie Sundra of Alpenglow Industries, building a synthesizer, the Microdot web framework,learning to program ARM Assembly, a follow-up from the very first episode, and learn about capacitive touch sensors.\nFull transcript available here.\nShow Notes Episode Intro Welcome!\n00:22 Meet the Maker: Carrie Sundra of Alpenglow Industries (Paul #1) If you visit the About page on Alpenglow Industries’ website, Alpenglow mission statement is to To Teach You About Electronics Without Gatekeeping. It goes on to say:\nWe are passionate about representation in electronics - the field is still overwhelmingly white and male with only ~10% of electrical engineers identifying as women. Having worked in the field for over 20 years, we know how much gatekeeping and hostility there can be. We aim to provide a welcoming space where adults can learn about electronics without judgment or any previous experience.\nHomepage: https://www.alpenglowindustries.com Through-Hole Soldering Kits Surface mount soldering kits: SMT Soldering Kits YouTube channel: Alpenglow Industries 05:26 SynthUX Academy and Daisy Seed (Tod #1) Have you ever wanted to learn to make real high-quality synthesizers, not just the low-fi toys I’ve been goofing around with in CircuitPython or Arduino w/ Mozzi?\nThen you should know about Daisy Seed from ElectroSmith : https://electro-smith.com/\nDaisy Seed is a little $25 Arduino-looking board that is designed explicitly for audio manipulation and generation. It’s becoming a core component of many musical instruments from guitar pedals, to Eurorack modules, to stand-alone synthesizer keyboards.\nThe Daisy Seed board features a Cortex M7-class chip with 65 MB of RAM, stereo audio I/O at 24-bit @ 96 kHz, twelve 16-bit ADC pins and two 12-bit DACs for controls, and 31 GPIOs. And it fits on a breadboard!\nIt has a well-done Arduino library, a C++ DSP library, and you can even run Pd and Max patches on it. ElectroSmith libraries provide all the components you need to make a synth: oscillators, envelopes, filters, sequencers, delays, reverbs, etc. And some good docs too!\nI’ve been wanting “level up” my knowledge of Daisy Seed, but I need a push. And that push has been the SynthUX Academy. They’re a non-profit based in the Netherlands that offers in-person and online classes for how to make synthesizers. Many of their classes are available for free on Youtube and their class code is on GitHub.\n8:08 The Microdot web framework (Paul #2) The Microdot web framework was created by Miguel Grinberg, who wrote the Flask Mega Tutorial - Flask being a popular Python web framework. Microdot’s home page describes it as “The impossibly small web framework for Python and MicroPython” and is inspired by Flask. What’s interesting is that it can run on both CPython as well as a microcontroller running MicroPython.\nMicrodot project page: https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot Microdot documentation The Flask Mega-Tutorial: The Flask Mega-Tutorial, Part I: Hello, World! MicroPython awesome-list for web servers: Awesome MicroPython 10:25 ARM Assembly Deep-dives by Carlynorama (Tod #2) What’s lower-level programming than CircuitPython? Arduino maybe? Lower-level than that? Probably C code calling a C vendor SDK. Now what’s lower than even that? C code manipulating a chip’s I/O directly, I’d say. And the lowest level? Assembly language.\nCarlynorama has been doing a deep-dive on ARM assembly language lately. (disclosure: she’s my wife)\nShe started with an ATtiny45 in bare AVR C to set up the chip and blink an LED. She’s really familar with AVR from the original Arduino, so it was a natural jumping off point. On AVR, doing bare C to twiddle chip registers is very close to assembly language, since much of the work is figuring out which registers to twiddle to make something happen. Besides her real target was ARM chips.\nFor the SAMD21 ARM chips like what’s in the QT Py M0 or Trinket M0, she decided to start with assembly, in order to really understand how these chips work compared to AVR. The Cortex-M0+ ARM chips are more complicated than AVR, and the ARM instruction set is huge. But (confusingly) the Cortex-M0+ core in these chips only get a subset of the ARM instructions, making all the documentation about “ARM assembly” frustrating to read until you know which instructions are allowed for your chip.\nBut in about a week she’s gone from knowing no ARM assembly to getting an M0 chip up and blinking an LED, reading a button input, and being able to monitor it all via GDB. Along the way she’s been using online ARM simulators and teasing how STM32 ARM chip setup differs from SAMD21 setup.\nI’ve been watching from the sidelines, learning a little along the way, following her blog. And it’s been fascinating. You can really see how enormously powerful these chips are when you’re down at the lowest level like this. It makes you appreciate all the work that’s going on when you say pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP) or button = DigitalInOut(board.GP14).\nHer next steps I think are moving to some bigger ARM chips and to try out the Clang/LLVM compiler system instead of the GCC-based tools she’s currently using.\n19:20 One Year With the Bambu Labs P1P (Paul #3) Paul shares his experience after owning a the Bambu Labs P1P 3D printer.\nThe Bootloader Episode 1: Episode 1: Rock Stars are Just Like Us Bambu Lab P1 Series | Reliable Out-of-the-Box Performance P1 Series Bambu extends software and bug fix support until 2027 and 2029 respectively in a turnaround Reddit thread 23:08 Let’s talk about Capacitive Touch Sensors and Sliders (Tod #3) I have been experimenting with capacitive touch sensors for a while now. They can be a really fun and easy sensor to add to your project and require almost zero extra components if you have something like CircuitPython’s touchio library to help out.\nCaptouch sensors work by treating the touch pad as a capacitor that the microcontroller charges up (by setting the pad’s pin HIGH) and then seeing how long that capacitor takes to discharge and go LOW. When you put your finger on the pad, the capacitance increases and it takes longer to discharge. By watching for that change you tell “touched” from “untouched”.\nMy latest fascination has been with capacitive touch sliders, either linear or rotary. The rotary slider is like what the iPod had for many years: slide your finger around it like you’re spinning a little record.\nHow do these work? There’s a couple of different ways but the method that I’ve been trying out lately is the “interpolation” technique. This is where you use two or more interleaved pads and measure the comparative touch amounts between them to interpolate a position along them. Imagine splaying your fingers on each and and interleaving them: as you go from left hand to right hand, it’s 100% your left hand, then 75% your left hand, then 50/50 both hands, then 75% your right hand, and finally 100% your right hand.\nI’ve got a few projects that have touch pads laid out like this if you’d like to play yourself:\nhttps://github.com/todbot/touchwheels https://github.com/todbot/picoslidertoy Tod’s Tindie Store At the bottom of the “touchwheels” page are some useful links to the capsense design guidelines I’ve been heeding like this one: AN2934 - Capacitive Touch Sensor Design Guide (PDF)\nSupport The Bootloader If you like what you hear, one of the best things you can do to help the show is tell a friend or write a review.\n","categories":"","description":"Built from the ground up","excerpt":"Built from the ground up","ref":"/the-bootloader/blog/2024/04/29/episode-8-built-from-the-ground-up/","tags":"","title":"Episode 8: Built from the ground up"},{"body":"(upbeat music) - Welcome to The Bootloader, I’m Paul Cutler. - And I’m Tod Kurt.\nEach podcast we’ll be bringing you news, project updates, product talk from the tech and maker scenes.\nAnd for each episode, we’ll be talking about it around three, no more than five things and chat about them for a few minutes each.\nPaul, what do you have for us this week for your first one? - First up, I’ve got a segment that I like to call Meet the Maker.\nAnd first up is Carrie Sundra of Alpenglow.\nNow I’ve never met Carrie.\nI just follow her on Mastodon and the socials.\nAnd shame on me, but I’ve never took a good look at the products and services offered by Alpenglow.\nI visited their website and if you visit the about page, I wanted to share Alpenglow’s mission statement, which is to teach you about electronics without gatekeeping.\nIt goes on to say, we are passionate about representation in electronics.\nThe field is still overwhelmingly white and male with only 10% of electrical engineers identifying as women.\nHaving worked in the field for over 20 years, we know how much gatekeeping and hostility there can be.\nWe aim to provide a welcoming space where adults can learn about electronics without judgment or any previous experience.\nSo right there, you know it’s a business that you want to support and do business with.\nThat is just such a cool mission statement to share with the world.\nAnd it’s something that I’m passionate about too, that whole women in tech and under-representation in tech.\nAnd it’s great to see her trying to bring people into electronics and soldering.\nWhat sparked my interest was on Mastodon a couple weekends ago they shared a learn to solder surface mount kit.\nAnd that got me to visit the shop and I saw the various learn to solder through hole kits as well as surface mount.\nNow I’m terrible at soldering.\nI just started soldering within the last couple of years.\nAnd if I had known about this a couple of years ago, I probably would have picked one out.\nI still don’t know how to do surface mount soldering.\nSo I’m tempted to buy one of those.\nAnd the kit, which is called the SMT Garden, it’s only 20 bucks and it includes over a hundred different pieces from practice capacitors to different colors of LEDs, as well as resistors and a battery holder.\nSo there’s tons of stuff that you can practice soldering on.\nThere’s so many cool things in the shop that I encourage you to go spend a few minutes browsing, pick up something if you’re looking to learn to solder or improve your soldering skills.\nAnd that’s not all she does.\nShe also runs a learn electronics workshop and a learn to solder workshop and encourages those underrepresented in tech to attend.\nBe sure to check it out.\nI’ve included a number of links in the show notes. - I follow her on Acidon too.\nAnd like, I’m always seeing these great soldering classes and electronics classes that she gives.\nAnd like most soldering kits are kind of boring.\nThey’re like little square things that have like, you know, four little LEDs or something and they just blink or just go on.\nBut her PCB designs are beautiful, like little bits of art that light up.\nAnd it’s, especially for SMD, it’s a really great intro because like SMD seems kind of scary, but like, oh, this is just LEDs.\nYou know, if you mess one up, you still have three or four others that are gonna light up for just this one part.\nAnd there’s like four different parts of the whole PCB.\nAnd so, yeah, just even if it’s not turned on, it looks cool. - Yes. - And then if you add to it, then it’ll look even better. - Her products do look cool.\nI mean, there’s holiday themed one.\nThere’s a light up Krampus.\nThere’s some no soldering ones that are available.\nSo depending on what your skill set, there’s a little bit of everything for everyone, I think. - Yeah.\nYeah, it’s really cool ‘cause electronics is not that scary.\nIt just kind of looks scary. - It does.\nAnd I would say that’s my experience in the last few years is I really came into this thinking it was a lot scarier than it is.\nAnd it’s just amazing how much you pick up just doing it over and over again in the practice, which is perfect for something like this. - Yeah, like so much of things.\nIf you don’t keep using it, you kind of lose it. - Absolutely.\nWhat did you have up for us next? - From like intro to electronics to like some of the most complicated electronics that I know of is how to make a synthesizer.\nAnd so from previous shows and just if you follow me, you’ve probably seen that I’ve made little toy, kind of toy synthesizers using either Arduino with this library called Mozi or in circuit Python with the new synth IO functionality that’s built in a circuit Python.\nBut they’re kind of toys.\nLike there are a lot of real synthesis platforms out there that let you do like professional quality synthesizers.\nAnd I’ve never really gotten into them until recently.\nThere’s one module, it looks kind of like an Arduino called Daisy Seed from this company called Electrosmith.\nWe’ll have a link to it in the show notes.\nAnd it’s 25 bucks and it’s a Cortex-M7 chip, which is one of the most powerful microcontrollers you can get on a tiny board.\nAnd it has 65 megabytes of RAM.\nSo like, you know, RAM is important in when you’re making synthesizers or digital effects, like pedals, like guitar pedals and stuff, because you need that memory to act as the buffer for like the delay effect or something or the reverb effect.\nYou kind of need to store copies of the sound.\nWith this chip, sorry, this board, this Daisy Seed board also has a professional quality 24-bit 96 kilohertz audio input and output and stereo.\nAnd then for like knobs and stuff, it’s got 16 ADC, sorry, 12 16-bit ADC pins and two 12-bit DACs to control stuff.\n31 GPIO pins to like let you control LEDs or like drive a display or something or like read from an SD card.\nAnd it fits on a breadboard.\nSo it’s kind of like, you know, if someone made an Arduino and it grew up and wanted to make music, it’s kind of what the Daisy Seed is.\nAnd Electrosmith provides all these really great libraries for it, but they’re pretty complicated C++ libraries.\nThey’ve got a Arduino library that wraps the C++ stuff, but it’s still, you need to kind of know how to C++.\nSo it’s pretty daunting if you just like go and look at it and go through their tutorials, it’s like, whoa, that’s a lot.\nBut thankfully there’s this nonprofit in the UK called Synth UX Academy, sorry, not in UK, in the Netherlands.\nAnd they’ve been doing these online classes and, sorry, in-person and online classes that they’ve been streaming for free on YouTube and putting their code up on GitHub so that you can follow along.\nAnd they’re only using the Daisy Seed and they have this really great little PCB set they sell that’s like a little tiny synthesizer like platform.\nTheir whole idea was that like, hey, here’s a big gridded PCB with a lot of holes in it where you can put the knobs kind of wherever you want to design what interface you want your synthesizer to have and just quickly wire them up to the Daisy Seed and like wire up an output jack and boom, you’ve got a synthesizer.\nAnd so it’s been a really nice sort of intro level getting you slightly involved in the whole Daisy Seed way of thinking about how to deal with audio and how to generate audio or how to generate like a guitar pedal effects and stuff.\nSo it’s been really cool.\nI’ve been wanting to play with the Daisy Seed for years.\nI supported their Kickstarter back in like 2020 and it’s been sitting in a box since then. (laughs) But I finally, like just like in the last two weeks I’ve like gotten out of the box, started playing with it.\nAnd it’s all because of this, the Synth UX Academy YouTube videos and their GitHub stuff.\nSo if you’re into this sort of thing, check it out.\nIt’s really cool. - It looks just like, it’s just a microcontroller.\nIt looks a little bigger than a Pico.\nAnd it was only $21 when I looked at the website.\nI was kind of taken aback by how cheap it is for that much RAM and M7, like you said. - Yeah, and it’s used in like real products.\nLike there’s some guitar pedals that use it.\nThere’s some like official, you can go and buy them at like Guitar Center, I think.\nThere’s some synthesizers, like the thing called the Chompy.\nThat’s like this cute little synthesizer that has like uses computer key switch keys for its keyboard.\nIt uses a Daisy Seed inside of it.\nAnd then there’s a bunch of Eurek modules that use the Daisy Seed internally.\nAnd you wouldn’t know it.\nThey’re just like, they’re hidden and they just, oh, here’s this platform to do cool audio stuff. - That’s pretty neat. - So what’s your second one for this week? - My next one is the Microdot web framework.\nI’ve shared before that I enjoy programming for the web and Python.\nI’ve used both Pyramid and FastAPI web frameworks, but I recently came across the Microdot web framework for CPython and MicroPython, which I thought was interesting. - Interesting, yeah. - It was created by Miguel Grinberg, who wrote the Flask mega tutorial, Flask being a popular Python web framework as well.\nMicrodot’s homepage describes it as the impossibly small web framework for Python and MicroPython.\nAnd it’s inspired by Flask.\nWhat is interesting is that you’ll be able to prototype and write all your code and have it run on desktop Python, on CPython before you bring it over to a microcontroller running MicroPython.\nVirgin 2 was released this past December, and it looks like there may even be CircuitPython support.\nI saw Miguel had filed a few bugs with CircuitPython, so the Microdot test suite would pass, which is how I first came across Microdot was seeing the bug reports.\nSo I haven’t looked to see if it actually runs on CircuitPython, but it does run on MicroPython, and I was surprised to learn that there’s over a dozen different web frameworks for MicroPython, including Microdot.\nSo if you’re coming from the world of CPython and you’ve used Flask and you’re coming to the world of microcontrollers, it really looks like Microdot might be the perfect web framework to bridge both of those worlds. - That’s really amazing.\nI’m really impressed.\nLike I did some networking, some UDP networking stuff a couple months ago.\nThat was mostly for CircuitPython, but because the API, the network API is a CircuitPython and normal Python, or CPython, are so close, I was able to have my library support both.\nAnd that was really cool because yeah, I could do all my development on the desktop and then try it in CircuitPython and it would just work.\nI’m just like, this is kind of the promise of why MicroPython and CircuitPython exists is that you can take your learning from DesktopPython and apply it to embedded microcontrollers, which is amazing. - Exactly, or even the other way around as well. - Yeah, yeah, that’s very much true for me ‘cause I actually don’t know DesktopPython too much.\nI have heard of Flask though, so I’m gonna look at this Microdot thing. - There you go.\nWhat do you have for us next? - To go even deeper.\nSo like what’s lower level than CircuitPython? - C. - C, right, yeah, exactly.\nI was gonna say the next step down might be Arduino.\nLower than that would be C with like say a vendor SDK.\nLike you see you need to have some way of knowing some functions you can call to do like, make the pin go high, make the pin go low.\nBut what’s even lower than that, you could write C code that manipulates a chip’s registers directly because that’s really all this vendor SDK does is you can just know what memory locations, where the pin register lives and modify that with C.\nOr you go even lower, you could do assembly language, which I don’t know if you ever heard of assembly language, but it’s pretty much the lowest level.\nIt is these tiny instructions that represent the actual bits that are sent to the CPU and the CPU decodes those bits.\nAnd then that’s an instruction and it does one of the instructions, which could be load something by memory or add two registers together or something like that.\nAnd so Carlinorama, disclosure, she’s my wife, has been doing a deep dive on ARM assembly language.\nAnd I’ve been finding this really fascinating.\nSee, she started out, she knows Arduino and low level Arduino and AVR stuff very well for me.\nOriginal Arduino back in 2006 or so, she wrote some of the original documentation for the Arduino website back in 2006.\nShe knows all about like low level, bare bones, AVR stuff.\nAnd so she decided to kind of get back into it by writing some bare metal C code to drive an AC tiny 45, and which is a little eight pin AVR, unlike the larger like 28 pin AVR that’s in an Arduino.\nAnd she got that to work and it was like, that was a cool couple of days of work.\nBut now, ‘cause like her real target is to learn, not necessarily to learn ARM assembly, but to learn how ARM chips work.\nBecause she has some like, she has some plans down the road.\nAnd so she went to a Trinket M0, which is a SAMD21 ARM chip and started, instead of just programming an Arduino or programming C, she’s like, nope, I’m gonna go with the bottom level.\nI’m gonna figure out how this chip starts up when you apply power, what does the chip start to do?\nOkay, I’m gonna feed it code to know how to do that.\nAnd then within about a week or so, she got it to blink an LED.\nAnd then a couple of days later, she got it to read a button using the lowest level code as the ARM assembly.\nAnd it’s really cool because like, ARM chips are what are in all of our devices now, like our phones, our computers, they all use the ARM processor, the ARM instruction set.\nAnd so, unfortunately, the instruction set on these little chips, like the little ones that run Arduino and CircuitPython, they’re a kind of ARM called the Cortex-M series.\nAnd it’s the lowest level of the Cortex-M, the Cortex-M0.\nAnd so each one of those, each one of those sort of subsets are a smaller and smaller number of instructions that are available to you from what the big ARM instruction set has.\nSo the big ARM instruction set has like really big, cool instructions for doing DSP functions and stuff like that.\nBut when you’re on the little microcontroller, you get like the bare minimum.\nSo trying to figure out when you just type in ARM assembly on Google, gives you this wide range of information and you have to figure out what part of this is applicable to these tiny chips.\nAnd so that was like coming into one of the first hurdles that I was watching her get over.\nLike, I don’t know any of this.\nI know assembly a little bit from like Apple II, you know, way back a long time ago. - Sure. - But my current assembly language knowledge is pretty, pretty scant.\nSo it’s really fun to like just kind of sit back and see her figure out this stuff and then kind of draft off her and kind of do it off to the side myself to see if I can make stuff work.\nAnd sometimes I can’t.\nBut it’s these instruction sets, the really cool thing about the ARM instruction set is it’s really regular.\nLike the old instruction sets of like the Apple II and the x86 chips, they were what’s called the complex, CISC, complex instruction set.\nWhat does the C stand for?\nThe complex CISC, complex instruction set, something.\nAnd then RISC, which is what ARM is, is the reduced instruction set, something.\nAnd so the cool thing about RISC is that you have a fewer number of instructions overall, but the instructions are very regular.\nAnd so you don’t have all these different ways of loading from a memory location.\nYou just have one.\nAnd then you do have to do everything in the register.\nIt’s hard to explain, but without going into a hour long description of like instruction sets.\nBut I know a little bit about this now. (laughs) - That’s pretty cool.\nYou’ve got to be pretty curious to go all the way down to that low level and start building back up. - Yeah, no, she’s very much like a documentarian approaching it.\nShe’s been blogging about all of this in this little blog she has off to the side of her main sort of blog of like, let’s see what are all the different possible ways this can be done and then figuring out the way that actually is the right way.\n‘Cause not only is there this subsetting of the ARM instruction set, but there’s also all these different chips that implement the Cortex-M0 instruction set.\nThere’s the SAMD21, which is what we’re familiar with, like the original QTPI.\nThere’s the STM32 chips, which are really, really popular and really common, but neither of us have any experience with STM32, but yet there’s a lot of documentation on the STM32 assembly language for some reason.\nAnd then there’s like people talking about these more complicated STM32 ARM chips for audio stuff, which is what I was running into.\n‘Cause I was seeing that like, oh, some of these synthesizer people implement large chunks of their very complicated DSP code as really tight assembly language loops inside of a much larger C program that does the synthesizer.\nAnd so it’s like, well, that’s not applicable to this problem of like programming a QTPI, (laughs) but it’s interesting. - Right. - But like along the way, she also learned that there’s a really great ARM simulator, online ARM simulator you can go to and you can like just type in some language instructions into it and compile it in the browser.\nAnd you can kind of step through it with a little built-in debugger and it’s like cycle accurate emulation apparently for a bunch of different types of chip architectures.\nAnd that was really, really fascinating to see that.\nShe also learned how to actually run and use GDB, which I don’t know if you ever had to use GDB before, I’ve used it once, you know, 20 years ago, but it’s a way of hooking into your program and telling it to stop and telling it to step, step, step, one instruction at a time and setting break points at certain parts in your code so you can kind of inspect the state of the program without having to use print statements.\nSo it’s really powerful way of debugging your program.\nUsually pretty hard to do on an embedded system, but these ARM chips have a built-in debugging system called SWD, software debugging I think is what it stands for.\nAnd so you can use these little $10 programmers that just hook into a couple of pins on the chip and then you can just use GDB to it and tell it to stop and inspect registers and inspect memory locations and see, okay, yes, my code did accurately twiddle this one little memory location that represents the pin register to cause it to be like turn the LED on or off or whatever. - Very cool. - Yeah, so it’s incredibly fascinating.\nIt makes me appreciate all the work that goes into when you write in Arduino, say pin mode and input pull-up, or when you say in Circuit Python, button equals digital in out and your pin number.\nThere’s a lot of stuff, like you just look at the C code that it goes, that goes and does that, maybe it’s only one or two lines, but then you see all the assembly language instructions that have to happen to make that work and it’s pretty cool.\nAnd then her next steps are, I think, going to move to the Clang compiler system.\nSo there’s this kind of two different ways of compiling for chips.\nThere’s the older and more sort of established GCC toolset and then there’s this new thing called Clang and LLVM, Clang is kind of the front end, LLVM is kind of the back end, I think.\nAnd that’s, I think the future maybe.\nSo that’s where she’s heading next, I think.\nAnd I’m fascinated to see that ‘cause I know nothing about Clang. - Yeah, it’ll be fun to watch. - It’s all right.\nSo what’s your third one today? - Mine is a callback to way back in episode one in September of 2022.\nI had talked briefly about the bamboo X1 carbon 3D printer, which had just hit the market at the time.\nI had mentioned a good friend of mine had bought one and I questioned how long it would last.\nWell, after watching him have his for about six months later, I bought one.\nSo I’ve just passed the one year mark of having one and I have the P1P model.\nI know it’s not an open source printer and I’ll take some flack from it, but I gotta say a year later, it still just works. - Oh, wow. - I don’t have to fiddle with the bed.\nI don’t get clogged nozzles.\nNow I know that I went from an Ender 3 to a bamboo, which is kind of like going from a really cheap car to a really nice car.\nBut the worst thing I can say about it is that I have to keep my greasy fingers clean when I’m taking things off the bed.\nJust trying to keep the bed clean is probably the worst problem I have.\nAnd if that’s the worst problem you have when you come to 3D printing, then you’re doing something right. - Yeah, I’ve heard so many good things about it.\nPeople are claiming it’s like a toaster where you just go to it and you just push the button and it works and it seems so fast to print from what I’ve heard.\nIt’s like, man, that’s amazing. - Well, that’s been my experience.\nAnd bamboo was actually in the news this week.\nIt looks like they tried to slip something by their users and it didn’t get through, which was claiming that their software would only be updated through 2025.\nWell, there was a big brouhaha about it and they came out today actually and said, “Nope, they’re gonna support the printer’s firmware through 2027 and security fixes through 2029.”\nSo that’s pretty interesting when you think 2027, that’ll give the printer four years of life, which in this industry is probably not too bad. - Yeah, totally.\nBut yeah, that’s always the danger with any of these complicated computing-based devices is how long does their support last because things seems to always decay.\nLike the software-based things always decay unless you keep updating them nowadays. - Right, and you could argue that their firmware is exactly that.\nPeople either love it or hate it every time an update comes out, it seems.\nBut they’ve done a good job with documentation.\nThey’ve got a Wiki which includes maintenance tips and when to perform them.\nI know the bamboo costs more than your average 3D printer, but for me, it’s been worth every penny ‘cause as I said, it just works. - Yeah, yeah, I’ve been involved trying to play 3D printer for jeez, forever, like since kind of the first MakerBots.\nAnd I got so sick of having them be a hobby rather than a tool.\nAnd so at one point, I bought like a really expensive one just to like get, just to get out of the morass of like always tuning the printer to get it to work properly.\nAnd then just like pay too much money and get a printer that works.\nAnd thankfully now, getting a printer that works is really low cost comparatively.\nUsed to be like $20,000. - Right.\nNow anywhere from 300 to call it $1,600 if you get like a fully loaded bamboo with the AMS and all that kind of stuff. - The AMF, that’s the one where it can like change the filament color or change which filament you’re printing with. - Yep, up to four filaments you can have loaded at any time and it can auto switch them out. - That’s crazy.\nIt’s like, yeah. - I did not shell out for that.\nThe printing I do is still pretty basic.\nIt’s prototypes and that kind of stuff.\nI don’t need, you know, I’m kind of, I’ve been through the phase where I printed the pretty toys that was already behind me by the time I got this.\nSo I didn’t need an AMS to do the multicolor printing. - Totally. - What’s your last one for us this week? - All right, so let’s talk about capacitive touch sensors and sliders.\nSo if you haven’t followed me again, you’ve probably been seeing that I’ve been playing with, I’ve been exploring capacitive touch sensors and they’re a really great way of adding buttons to your project without actually having to have any extra hardware, except for like one little resistor per button.\nAnd so if you can make a PCB, you can have 10, 20 buttons.\nLike I’ve got a little a MIDI keyboard that’s got I think 25, it’s a 25 key keyboard I think, you know, just with cap touch pads and an Arduino, sorry, a Raspberry Pi Pico.\nOne of the things I’ve been wanting to play with is the little sliders, like you’ve seen, like the most famous is like the second version of the iPod touch wheel or scrolly wheel.\nAnd the first one was a mechanical little thing that moved, but the second version and kind of all the way up to I think till the end, was this non-moving capacitive touch surface that you just kind of scrolled your finger around on.\nI’ve seen in some of the capacitive touch design guidelines, how to make one of these types of little wheels and the wheels are actually just a special case of a linear slider uses the same technique.\nAnd so I’m like, let me try to build something like this.\nAnd so first, how do these capacitive sensors work?\nThe way that the technique that I use, that is one of the really common ones is, so all wires, all traces on a PCB are actually little capacitors.\nLike when you set them high, it actually takes some time to get to that high state because the capacitance of the metal and the fiberglass and the ground plane on the bottom, that forms a little capacitor and it has to take time to charge up that wire that is your signal trace or your capacitive touch pad takes some amount of time.\nAnd then when you make it go low again, it takes some time.\nIt’s not instantaneous.\nNothing in electronics is instantaneous, even though you said, go low now.\nIt’s like, well, it takes a little bit of time.\nAnd that time is driven by that capacitance of the physical copper on the PCB.\nAnd so you can use that effect if you make that piece of copper bigger, like finger sized.\nAnd then if you tell your microcontroller to raise that pad to the high state and then time how long it takes to go low, you are now able to detect, is there a person touching the pad or not?\nBecause what happens is if you put your finger next to a copper trace, you add your body’s capacitance to the capacitance that’s inherently on the PCB.\nAnd it like, I think it’s like maybe two or three times.\nIt’s almost like you’re adding another capacitor’s worth of charge when you put your finger next to it.\nSo it’s kind of cool.\nIt’s like this like really ambient physical effect.\nYou can, there was normally like a bad thing in electronics that like, oh, your finger’s affecting the circuit, but we’re using it to actually affect a usable, useful technique, which is like, oh, and I have a little fake button by having just a piece of copper on a PCB.\nAnd so that’s how just on/off buttons work.\nWell, the sliders work by just having three or more of these copper surfaces and they interleave them.\nKind of like if you take your two fingers and sort of like, sorry, take your two hands and sort of splay your fingers and put them together.\nWhen you interleave the copper traces like that, and if you then put your finger somewhere on that gradient of like the two copper pieces, if you’re like, if you’re to touch, say on your left side of your hand, when your fingers are kind of connected like that, then you’ll get just the left hand.\nAnd as you move your finger across to the right hand, you’ll get less and less of the left hand and more and more of the right hand as you move your finger across.\nAnd so that’s kind of how these things work is you, instead of reading like just an on/off value, you kind of read a analog value of what that capacitance changes in the pads.\nAnd you can have not just two pads that are interleaved, you can have say three or four or five, six, seven pads, and that will give you more resolution in a way, because you’re using more little individual pads to indicate where things are.\nI’m not sure how many of the original iPod slide, the touch wheel had, but the minimum that I’ve seen is about three.\nYou need three pads.\nAnd my little Pico slider toy, that little PCB that I came out with, uses this three pad technique for doing two rotary dials and three vertical sliders.\nIt actually kind of works.\nIt’s using a Raspberry Pi Pico, and the code for it is pretty simple code.\nIt’s like just simple sort of algebra, sort of linear sliding two values next to each other.\nAnd I don’t know, I’m pretty excited on like, what other dumb things I can do with it.\nLike the real downside of the capacitive touch is that there’s no feedback.\nYou know, with a button, when you push the button, you hear a click. - Right. - Some people pay a lot of money on the mechanical keyboards to get even a louder click than normal.\nAnd, but you get some sort of pushback, and there’s no pushback with these capacitive touch things.\nIt’s one of the downsides.\nIt’s one of the things that people levied against our phones compared to the phones that preceded it, because the big black screen of a iPhone doesn’t have any ridges to tell you where the buttons are, because you know, every interface has a different layout of buttons.\nBut we’re getting used to it.\nSo I feel like, you know, the capacitive touch is sort of like due for a comeback in terms of microcontroller interfaces, because we’re so used to the non-tactility of a phone surface that, you know, these flat capacitive touch surfaces of a microcontroller touch interface would be okay. - Right.\nSo you link to the code for both the touch wheels and the Pico Slider toy.\nIs the Pico Slider toy available on your Tindy store as well? - Oh yes, by the way, I have a Tindy store.\nAnd I have both the larger Pico Slider toy, which has something like 16 different controls and two rotary sliders, three linear sliders, and a bunch of buttons.\nAnd then also the prototype, my little touch wheel zero, that’s just one of those little rotary controls, like an iPod slide wheel.\nAnd those are both in the Tindy store if you want to try them out.\nAnd the code for it is like, yeah, like 10 lines of circuit Python. - That’s all we have for you this episode.\nFor detailed show notes and for transcripts, visit

We’re excited to return after an extended break. For episode 7, we dive into the just released CircuitPython 9 and discuss what we’re excited about and some of the new features.\nFull transcript available here.\nShow Notes Episode Intro Welcome! This is all about the new CircuitPyton 9.0 release\nWhat are we excited for in CircuitPython 9?

Here’s a comment from CircuitPython Core Developer Dan Halbert: The “split heap” code from MicroPython now enables us to use heap allocation outside the VM, which was very awkward before: any dynamic storage allocation could only be done once, before the VM started. The heap then used the remaining RAM. Now there is an “outside” heap which can be used while the VM is running, and that storage will not be garbage collected. So various storage allocations that used to be static can now be dynamic, such as stuff needed for USB setup. We also removed the “long-lived storage” scheme that was added a long time ago to reduce fragmentation. In that scheme, storage that we expected to live a very long time (mostly allocations for compiled bytecode) was allocated at one end of the heap, and shorter-lived storage (like the temp storage used during compilation) was allocated at the other end. Part of the scheme involved moving allocated objects and adjusting pointers. The moving caused some inherent but obscure problems where objects’ identities seemed to change.\nNow long-lived storage is gone, because it was not very compatible with the split-heap scheme. This may cause some projects on small-RAM boards like SAMD21 not to work any more due to increaed fragmentation. We have some ideas for doing something like long-lived storage in a different way that wouldn’t involve moving objects, but that won’t be in 9.\nThe MicroPython merges are huge undertakings. Props to the CircuitPython team for even trying to track upstream. For example, the 1.20 update touched 779 files over 250 commits. And they did 3 merges! (MicroPython 1.19.1, 1.20.0, and 1.21.0) paralleldisplaybus 8x faster display using paralleldisplaybus instead of SPI Currently for ESP32- and RP2040- based chips e.g. LilyGo T-Display S3 AMOLED and LilyGo T-Display S3 CircuitPython for ESP32 updates to ESP-IDF 5 CircuitPython 9 moves from using ESP IDF 4.x to ESP IDF 5 This will enable new features and new boards, like ESP32-C6 Potential future support for Bluetooth on ESP32 boards that support BLE ConnectionManager Paul got his description wrong - ConnectionManager is used by adafruit_requests and MiniMQTT to manage sockets. Created by community member Justin Myers It’s great how even with Adafruit funding three core developers that it’s truly a community project and a community member can add a new library and way of doing things to CircuitPython. Makes socket tasks easier, like this example Breaking Changes in CircuitPython displayio changes: display.show() deprecated displayio drivers have moved See this FAQ Mounting a filesystem (SD card) requires an existing directory, like CPython CircuitPython now requires explicit socket port re-use. Use socket.setsockopt(pool.SOL_SOCKET, pool.SO_REUSEADDR, 1), as in CPython.

Show"},{"body":"[MUSIC] Hi, welcome to the Bootloader.\nI’m Tod Kurt.\nI’m Paul Cutler.\nWe’re back after an extended break with a special episode breaking down the recently released CircuitPython 9.\nIt’s been just over a year since CircuitPython 8 was released in February 2023, and Tod and I are going to chat about what’s new and what we think is cool in CircuitPython 9.\nWith that said, Tod, what are you excited about in this release?\nAll right.\nThere’s a ton of things, but I’m going to list four real quick without any explanations.\nWe can get to them in detail as we go.\nJPEG I/O, parallel display bus, USB host, and ESP-IDF update.\nHow about you?\nWhat are some of the things you’re excited by?\nJPEG I/O and the Momento camera definitely.\nCircuitPy on Android, I think is pretty cool.\nBrand new connection manager and USB host, I’m excited to learn more about.\nI haven’t played with it yet.\nSo let’s jump in.\nWe both had JPEG I/O on our list.\nThe Momento camera just came out in the last couple of months and was just unveiled in the latest AdaBox as well.\nHave you had a chance to play with a Momento?\nI have.\nYeah.\nI ended up getting a board before the AdaBox, but then I also got the AdaBox.\nOf course, there was JP’s wonderful unboxing video that he did last night, which was the 20th of March, 2024.\nSo there have been other, so it’s an ESP32-S3, I think, baseboard that has on it a camera module, microphone, SD card slot, bunch of this stuff, accelerometer.\nBut it’s ESP32, so it’s Wi-Fi capable, Bluetooth capable.\nBut the camera module writes JPEG.\nLike when you turn it on and say, “Take a picture,” it spits out JPEG data that you’re supposed to just save to disk as a JPEG file.\nSo that raises the question, how do you read that on a CircuitPython device?\nSo now we have JPEG I/O, which allows you to decode JPEGs and load them, load JPEG images into CircuitPython and display them on a screen.\nThat’s a big deal.\nI mean, we had a bitmap support and most everything is using bitmaps, but there’s also ping support, but you don’t see a lot of it.\nBut JPEG is the standard for everything.\nYou can get small enough file sizes and all that fun stuff.\nSo it’s pretty cool to see that added.\nYeah.\nIt’s incredible.\nThe one downside of JPEGs compared to the other image formats that we like to use in CircuitPython, the BMP or the PNGs, is those can be palletized, which means you can choose exactly how many colors your image has.\nSo if you have a specifically just black and white image, you can say, “Only use one bit per pixel for this image,” which makes the image on your disk a little bit bigger because there’s no real compression in BMPs.\nBut it means that in memory, the CircuitPython image buffer will be much smaller.\nWith JPEGs, JPEGs are like the full color space.\nSo I think that it stores them as a 16-bit color, two bytes per pixel.\nSo it’s a bit bigger.\nSo JPEG I/O will only probably work really well on ESP32 devices, things with lots of RAM, but it’s like we got it.\nI think one of the really neat things about it too is it shows how Adafruit’s innovating around the product, the hardware, and the software coming together to create the product.\nYeah.\nIt’s almost Apple-like that when you can have influence over both of those things, you can have an experience that’s really pretty cool.\nYeah.\nI’ve had a couple of these little ESP cams.\nYou can get them pretty cheap off of AliExpress or whatever that are what the Memento was based on.\nIt’s got ESP32 with one of these little low-cost camera modules hooked up to it, and some simple C code that shows basically how to just write the file.\nBut it’s not a product.\nIt’s not really anything that’s usable.\nWhereas the Memento is super usable, partly because it’s got a good design physically, but also because now you can do it all in CircuitPython.\nThe first open-source powered camera.\nYeah.\nThat’s pretty darn cool.\nYeah, it’s pretty awesome.\nOne of the other things I like about the Memento effort was that one of the CircuitPython devs, Jepler, added a bunch of image effects in a general way with this thing called a new library in the core called Bitmap Filter.\nThis lets you do what’s called convolution filters, which is your standard Photoshop filters.\nYou can do things like sepia tone or blur or unsharp mask or whatever.\nBut it is pretty cool how that piece of hardware is driving the software innovation that Adafruit is working on.\nTotally.\nNext up, let’s chat about USB host.\nI understand you’ve played around with that a bit.\nI have not.\nI’ve played around with a little bit on other systems, not much in CircuitPython world yet.\nBut yeah, the thing I’ve mostly played around with is that there are a lot of really interesting little USB MIDI keyboards out there in the world that are only USB.\nIt’d be really cool if you could plug these into something that’s not a full computer, but something that’s smaller that could then create normal MIDI, standard five-pin MIDI, or it could be a synthesizer in itself.\nSo with this new USB host functionality, we might actually get that.\nThe other thing it adds is keyboard support.\nOh, like for computer keyboards.\nYes, it does.\nScott, I think earlier this year, blogged in a CircuitPython 2024 wish list about how close we’re getting to an actual CircuitPython powered computer.\nWe’ve got the bigger displays and the quality is right.\nYou’ve got USB host, so you can actually have the keyboard, and now you’ve got the microcontroller working as a full-blown computer.\nIt’s almost back to the eight-bit days of yore.\nYeah.\nBack when we could turn on the computer and it would immediately give you a little prompt to let you start programming, like that was amazing.\nYou’d have to wait for it to boot up because you just turned it on and there it was.\nIt’s funny, I think not that it’s in CircuitPython 9 specifically, but I’ve seen work going on with a soft keyboard, so a software keyboard, as well as just a couple of weeks ago in Discord, and I don’t know the details, but someone was talking about how could we have a terminal actually in CircuitPython.\nOh, interesting.\nRight.\nI don’t know how that would work if it’s connected to the REPL or what, but there were some questions.\nI’m like, “Oh, every day we seem to get just a little bit closer.”\nYeah.\nIt’s amazing.\nIt’s a pretty complicated problem, it seems, where right now when you want to talk to CircuitPython, you connect via the serial REPL, this USB interface over generally the USB interface, but it looks like a serial port to your computer and you can control-C your program and you can start the program back up again and you can see printouts.\nBut then there’s also what’s called the web workflow, where you can do that same interaction but via a web page.\nThere’s also a Bluetooth workflow where you can do something similar, but with a little BLE app.\nNow we might have something where there’s a different workflow where the keyboard and the screen are connected directly to the microcontroller.\nSomehow these all work without them colliding.\nIf I do something in the web workflow, I can still see it in the serial REPL, I think.\nIt’s just a tour de force of programming to make all this work together.\nIt absolutely is.\nWith that said, we have to give credit to MicroPython.\nCircuitPython is a downstream fork of MicroPython.\nEvery major release of CircuitPython, they merge back in all the changes within MicroPython.\nIn this release alone in CircuitPython 9, there were three MicroPython merges that they made, 1.19.1, 1.20, and 1.21, were all merged into CircuitPython 9, which brings a lot of innovation.\nThere’s one thing called the split heap management.\nI actually looked into it and couldn’t understand it, so I went to one of the core developers, and Dan Halbert gave me a really great explanation.\nIt’s a little long to read here, I’ll include it in the show notes.\nBut especially if you have some of the boards with smaller amounts of memory like the SAMDs, you might have some memory issues going forward to watch out for.\nBut overall, it’s a really innovative change.\nI’ve also been looking at the piece of text that Dan gave you.\nI’m a pretty good coder, I feel, but this is a little bit beyond me.\nThose of you who want to know the guts and internals of CircuitPython, I want to know about what changed.\nWe’ve got the info for you.\nJust go to the bootloader.net and read the show notes.\nTotally.\nAbout the merge, I don’t know how many people who are listening have actually done merges to an upstream fork of code they’re using.\nBut it is a ordeal because you take this code, some piece of code, and you fork it, you make your own changes, and then the original makes their changes.\nAnd if you want to track what they’ve done, you have to go through this merge process.\nMan, if you’ve changed the same file, if you’ve decided to re-architect something to have a different way of thinking about a problem, it’s just a huge problem.\nAnd the fact that they’re still doing upstream merges, where they’re still trying to track what MicroPython is doing, so that CircuitPython is a subset of MicroPython is amazing.\nAnd I was looking at the changes just for the 1.2.0 MicroPython merge, the commit for that in CircuitPython touched 779 source files over 250 commits.\nAnd that’s pretty much- And they merged three of those.\nThree of those. (laughs) It’s like, this is a huge undertaking.\nAnd it seems to work, you know, that like, so we get some of the new thinking from MicroPython into CircuitPython.\nAnd sometimes some of the CircuitPython ideas bubble up to MicroPython, but sort of in an out of band way, because it would be hard for CircuitPython to sort of push changes back up directly.\nBut yeah, I think it’s really cool that we’re working together with MicroPython, CircuitPython.\nYeah, the beauty of open source.\nYep.\nNext up, let’s chat about parallel display bus.\nWhat’s going on there?\nAh, okay, so if you’ve used a little display, little like, you know, LCD or TFT OLED or something, you can talk to it via the I2C bus, which is two little wires kind of slowed around 400 kilohertz, or you can use the SPI bus, which is also two wires, but can operate to like 30 megahertz or so.\nAnd anytime you want to rewrite the entire screen, that could be kind of slow because you’re transmitting, you know, several hundred thousand bytes of data to rewrite all the pixels.\n‘Cause these displays are pretty dense, you know, like one of the ones I like to use is 240 by 240 pixels.\nAnd so you do your remote, you do your best to minimize whole screen updates.\nYou just want to change little bits that are changing on the screen rather than rewrite the whole screen each time.\nBut there are some really nice boards that LilyGo has made.\nThey’re another like maker of little microcontroller gizmos that have these really beautiful TFT color displays with an ESP32 board on the back.\nAnd, but they’re hooked up via what’s with a parallel technique, which is eight data bits instead of the one data bit that SPI has.\nAnd so you can essentially get like eight times the bandwidth.\nSo it’s like an eight times faster display.\nAnd CircaPython has sort of supported this, but only for certain chips and not for these cool LilyGo chips, which are ESP32.\nAnd so lately the parallel display bus has been turned on and fixed for ESP32.\nNow we can use these cool boards that have the really fast displays and you can update them really quickly. - So on the LilyGo displays, they’re actually built into the boards similar to like the reverse TFTs that Adafruit sells. - They look a lot like the reverse TFTs.\nYeah, yeah.\nAnd so it wouldn’t surprise me if Adafruit comes out with something similar ‘cause they can now take advantage of these parallel displays.\nAnd it’s kind of like, it’s really the native way of how you talk to these displays is via these parallel interfaces.\nYou have to go through extra work to talk via SPI or I swear to see.\nSo yeah, so I’m excited by it because I like to do a lot of cool graphic stuff with these little computers and watching things load the display is kind of, it’s like, oh man. - Sure. (laughing) - That’s not good for a little video game. - Next up, one of the things that I’m excited about, and you were just talking about something related to this is you have a number of different ways that you can work with CircuitPython.\nYou can plug, with most of the boards, you plug it in as the USB drive, it sees it, and you can edit the code.py right on there.\nThere’s the web workflow now where you can connect wirelessly and edit your code.\nYou can do it via Bluetooth.\nNow you can do it on an Android device.\nThey updated CircuitPython 9 with Android support.\nSo you can plug in a CircuitPython 9 device and actually write to your code.py right on there and unplug it and your microcontroller will run the code. - Oh, that’s so cool.\nYeah, because on Android, you can do serial devices over the cable, right? - I believe it’s over USB. - Yeah, yeah, ‘cause I think that’s one of the restrictions on iPhones is you can’t do USB serial or something, but that’s so cool.\nYeah, ‘cause we should be able to edit these things with a tablet, right?\n(laughing) - Right, we should be.\nBut as you said, Apple’s got all that market share, so not yet. - They prefer you to do everything via Bluetooth rather than with a physical cable for reasons that are only clear to them. (laughing) - This is true.\nNext up, let’s chat about the ESP-IDF. - Ah, yeah, so this is because I’m a big fan of these WiFi chips, ESP32.\nThere’s a bunch of different types of ESP32s that are, unfortunately, they all have the name ESP32 and they’re very, very different.\nSo like the ESP32-S2 is a single core WiFi only, but the ESP32-S3 is dual core with WiFi and Bluetooth.\nSo it’s just very confusing.\nBut the underlying sort of code API that we all use to write software for these is called the ESP-IDF.\nIt’s an SDK that Espressif, the company that makes ESP32s, puts out.\nAnd for the longest time, CircuitPython was using ESP-IDF 4, which was like two or three years ago version, and it supported only a certain amount of chips, a certain number of the chips, and it only supported certain of the features.\nMost notably, we couldn’t get, I think, Bluetooth support on some of the newer chips we like to use.\nAnd so through a big effort, similar to the effort of merging with upstream MicroPython, was updating the ESP-IDF to version 5, which enables CircuitPython to have new chip support.\nLike there’s this ESP32-C6 coming out soon that I think has WiFi mesh or something.\nI forget, but there’s all these new ESP32 chips coming out, and also it fixes some of the Bluetooth stuff.\nSo we should have BLE support for ESP32s soon, which has been a sticking point.\nPeople are like, oh, you know, CircuitPython has such good Bluetooth support.\nWell, only for the Nordic NRF chips. - Right.\nAnd I’d caution you, I wouldn’t say that expressive Bluetooth support is coming soon. - Oh, no. - Hopefully it’s coming. - Yeah, no, no.\nIt’s like now it’s possible, whereas before it wasn’t even possible. - Right.\nSo I don’t want people to get their hopes up too much right away. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nBut if anyone knows ESP-IDF and wants to help kind of flush out the Bluetooth support for CircuitPython for the ESP chips, you know, go to the GitHub and you can help out immensely. - Or join the CircuitPython Discord.\nThere’s a user, a community member working on Bluetooth support for the Pico right now. - All right. - Being done via community members.\nSo, you know, which is a great segue to the next thing that I’m excited about, which is Connection Manager. - Yeah, what is this?\nI’ve only heard about it obliquely. - So from what I understand, and I haven’t updated my wireless code yet, is they’ve standardized the ability of how you connect to Wi-Fi when you’re instantiating the network on the microcontroller itself.\nSo if you were using an airlift, you did it one way.\nIf you did it with built-in Wi-Fi, you did it a different way.\nFrom what I understand, if I’m understanding it correctly, a lot of that code has just been simplified so there’s one right way to do it and it figures it out for you.\nDon’t quote me on that.\nWhat I think is so cool about it is a couple of different things.\nOne, it’s snuck in right under the release.\nBut two, it was done by a gentleman by the name of Justin who’s a community member.\nHe partnered up with the core developers, figured out how to build CircuitPython, how the CI works.\nIt was great seeing him get involved and it’s great seeing that a community member’s involvement resolves in a whole new library built into CircuitPython. - That’s great.\nThat is one of the nicest things about the CircuitPython team, the distributed global community that’s working on this, which some of them work at Adafruit, is that they’re very welcoming.\nIt’s like, oh, if you’ve got something that you wanna contribute, submit a PR, let’s try it out.\nYeah, I’ve created a couple different libraries and people are like, yeah, we’ll put it in the official bundle that you can then use to, that anyone can then easily install.\nSo, yay.\nI can’t wait to try out this connection manager ‘cause that’s always been the real bummer is that if you are using one of these Wi-Fi add-on boards, the way you started up the Wi-Fi was totally different.\nThe way you got sockets and stuff was totally different than doing the ESP32 native Wi-Fi stuff. - And I’m not the most technical, so don’t quote me, but that’s my understanding of how it works.\nAnd I’m sure if I’m wrong, I’ll hear about it and we can issue a correction notice next episode. - Well, that’s how we get the viewer numbers up, right?\nOr the listener numbers up is we say something purposefully wrong so that we’ll get more engagement. (laughs) - Oh, a little controversy for you right there. (laughs) Last up, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention some of the things that CircuitPython 9 no longer supports.\nSo there’s a couple of things that have been deprecated.\nThe big one for me personally is using display.show, parentheses, and then you would put your group name in the function.\nNow it’s display.groupgroup equals the group name that you created earlier in the process.\nSo that’s a big one for me as I’m going through slowly and updating all my devices that have displays so that they work correctly.\nNext up is file system mounts need to be on an existing directory.\nSo no longer can you have the drive blank, you need to manually create a /sd directory, for example, if you’re using SD cards. - Yeah, that one, I’m not, even though, so as an old Unix nerd who knows that like, whenever you mount a disk, you must first create the directory and then use the mount command to say, put this disk at this directory.\nSo it’s always a two-step process.\nI really liked the old CircuitPython way of just like, hey, mount this thing at that directory. (laughs) It was so much simpler. - Sure. - But yeah, so now it’s more in line with how real Python works, but I kind of miss the old way. - Yup.\nAnd speaking of being more in line with how C Python works, the last change is CircuitPython now requires explicit socket port reuse. - Yeah. - So you can see in the show notes, the actual command that you would have to use. - Yeah. - But that aligns to how C Python does it, which makes sense why they would make a breaking change like that. - Yeah.\nYeah, I’m glad they’re getting more and more close to C Python, to the desktop Python, ‘cause I wrote a networking library, a little UDP library recently, and I was able to support both C Python and CircuitPython with just a very small, like two or three line changes in the middle of like, basically, how do you get a socket?\nAnd I’m like, oh, this is nice, ‘cause this means I could do like almost all my testing on my laptop with no device connected, and then like just do the couple line changes and try it out on a CircuitPython device, and it all works. - Well, that’s pretty cool.\nSo lastly, I think we should give some credit to everyone who contributed to CircuitPython 9’s development, who beta tested it through the long beta testing process that went on, who filed issues, who left feedback in Discord, who participated in the CircuitPython 2024 wishlist.\nIt’s a great community.\nThat’s why I did the CircuitPython 9 show.\nThat’s how we met.\nWe’re both still in the Adafruit community.\nSo thank you to everyone who’s had any part in bringing CircuitPython 9 to life, and thank you to Adafruit for sponsoring CircuitPython. - Totally, and if anybody is interested in like, kind of getting in and like kind of listening to the development process of CircuitPython, there’s a weekly meeting via Discord audio, whatever that feature’s called.\nYou can join just to listen in.\nYou don’t have to present or anything.\nThe core developers, but also people that are just like writing libraries and stuff, and you can listen in and see if you want to participate actively, or it’s also good just to get a behind the scenes as to what’s kind of coming up in CircuitPython, ‘cause you’ll see somebody, like I saw that Jepler was working on JPEG I/O like three months ago or whatever, (laughs) and I was like, “Oh, I can’t wait.” (laughs) - Right, and that’s where Connection Manager has been discussed in the Weeds section at the end of the meeting.\nSo that’s a great idea.\nIt’s Mondays at 2 p.m.\nEastern.\nCheck it out if you’re interested in joining the CircuitPython community.\nWe’re members, we love it.\nI think that enthusiasm comes through, and thanks for listening to the episode.\nAnd I’m Paul Cutler. - And I’m Tod Kurt. - Thank you for listening to The Bootloader.\nFor show notes and transcripts, visit thebootloader.net.\nIf you use Mastodon, you can follow the show on Mastodon to be notified when new episodes are released.\nVisit thebootloader.net, click on the follow us link, and enter your Mastodon handle.\nUntil next time, stay positive.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n","categories":"","description":"Episode 7 Transcript - The CircuitPython 9 Release Show","excerpt":"Episode 7 Transcript - The CircuitPython 9 Release Show","ref":"/the-bootloader/blog/2024/03/22/episode-7-transcript/","tags":"","title":"Episode 7 Transcript"},{"body":"Welcome Welcome to The Bootloader!

I’m Tod Kurt.\nPaul Cutler 0:05\nAnd I’m Paul Cutler. Today we have a special supersized edition of the bootloader for you. Rather than covering a number of topics for five minutes, Tod just got back from Supercon in I’ve been peppering him with questions about it. So I thought we’d bring some of those questions to the show for those of us like me who couldn’t be at Supercon. So with that, Tod, tell us what is super kind of where’s it held?\nTod Kurt 0:26\nSo Supercon is the is the long long name is the Hackaday super conference. hackaday.com is a blog that’s been around for like 15 years originally started, I think by Phil Torrone now of Adafruit. Its whole purpose was to showcase interesting, cool hardware hacks that are happening in the community. You know, back in the old days, it was maybe only once a day, but now there’s like tons of content. So if you ever want to like learn how to do cool hardware, hacking things from like, simple stuff, to really complicated things, Hackaday is a really good resource for that. I’ve learned so much just by reading the website. And so super con is a way of getting a lot of people that do a lot of the stuff together, like, hey, let’s have a conference of all these cool hacking projects. And this has been, I think, maybe this is like the eighth year or something. It’s been going on for a while. And it’s been held mostly in Pasadena, California, which is just outside of Los Angeles, there’s a reason why it’s there is because supply frame, the now owners of Hackaday, their headquarters is in Pasadena. And they’ve got a supply frame design lab, which is sort of a sort of like a hackerspace. But it’s more like a design studio with really good tools like laser cutters and CNC mills and resin printers and a bunch of other really interesting stuff. And so it’s held there and next door with there’s this LA College of Music has a really big, nice big stage with really good lighting and stuff. And so there’s like the main stage, the LA College of Music, this little literally right next door. And in the Design Lab, that’s sort of the second smaller stage. And they have talks going on concurrently. And both of those, and then in between in the alley, there is a bunch of tables set up, where probably like 100, people can just unlock a bunch of soldering irons and like parts sponsored by Digi key, we’re going to start go and start hardware hacking your your things. And so a lot of people will bring their projects that are like in a mostly finished state. And they’ll go there and they’ll be hacking on things. There’s also batch hacking, which we’ll talk about in a second.\nPaul Cutler 2:15\nThat’s so cool. I had no I had no idea that they actually had soldering irons on site right there where you can actually start hacking on your hardware.\nTod Kurt 2:22\nYeah, it’s amazing. And people will bring bring stuff like this year, I saw a fully functioning Apple two plus, I saw some weird CPM computer with full CRT monitor, there’s just like some really weird ancient stuff that people will somehow just cart to the conference and just set up on these tables. And then the start soldering onto it. You know, some people were setting up your rack, little synthesizers they were making by themselves and they implemented they integrated the badge into the Eurorack system, somehow it was, it was just crazy. And these people are overall, much better engineers than me, I would say. So it’s really interesting to see a lot of the stuff stuff people are doing. There’s like super high density, surface mount soldering going on that like people bring microscopes. So they can like look at the surface mount soldering. It’s just, it’s just insane.\nPaul Cutler 3:15\nThat’s amazing. So we hinted at it. But tell me about the badge. So I think it actually started at DEF CON, where they converted badges to actually microcontrollers or circuit boards,\nTod Kurt 3:25\nI find that the fact that we’re calling them badges are kind of hilarious, because as someone who loves to go to these some of these conferences, but have kind of a hard time interact with people, I really liked the actual badge of a conference because I can see their name, I can see their name and their face. And I could like you know, kind of get oh, and then maybe their company that has a badge of the company. So I could have this nice little package that helped me remember this person, because I’m terrible, that kind of stuff. Now, what are badges now badges are special purpose microcontroller boards that are designed for the event, they’re a one time created thing, they’re more of an art piece than a than a product. With a lot of these badges, you’re expected to modify the badge on site. During the three days of the conferences, we DEF CON works is the way super con works. And there’s other conferences that have similar things this year is bad. Looks like this will include a picture of that in the show notes. Yeah, if you’re watching on the video, and we kind of have this little bit, it is a recreation in a way of the old computers from like the 70s, where you had keyboards and screens, you had DIP switches and lights. And so the way you keyed in the program is you flip the various switches that indicated the bits of the command and the bits of the data and you flip the switch the said load and that would that would change one memory address and then you would go to the next memory address and flip the flip the switches and eventually you would input like 100 or 200 instructions and then you’d flip the run switch and your program would run and the lights would would change and you’d see The output and so that’s what this is. It’s a it’s a recreation of that it’s running on a PIC microcontroller. And some people there were keying instructions on the little like switches that are on the badge by hand. But there’s also a serial port. And if you go to the serial port, you can upload the via like a bootloader process, you can upload a precompiled sort of machine code thing on the event, people were writing web based compilers for this thing for in various languages and stuff. And so it’s got like, like, you know, 30 bytes of RAM, it’s got it’s got some, some very small amount because it is a recreation of these really, like initial computers that existed back in the in the 60s and 70s.\nPaul Cutler 5:36\nThat’s pretty cool is there one or two badges that you saw that really stood out? The cleverness\nTod Kurt 5:41\nis, so there’s there’s the cleverness of just hacking the badge, sorry, of just programming the badge. Like just to be able to do that, like I wasn’t able to actually really get into the programming because, you know, I did, I did the sort of machine language stuff when I was first learning computers on an Apple two, I don’t really want to do that and don’t do that anymore. Not a nostalgia for to it for me, but just people doing some amazing like, I think someone had like a fractal render written in this machine code. But like the one of the best ones that I think it won the badge hacking contest that happens at the end of the event was Zach, and I forget who too long time Hackaday member Hackaday community members made a punch card reader for as a way to input programs into the into the badge. And instead of using like extra components to actually unsoldered some of the LEDs that were on one badge to turn the LEDs into sensors. Because LEDs, LEDs work both ways. They both can emit light and the consensus light. So they had the sandwich of of a row of LEDs on one side and a row of LEDs a sensors on the other side. And if you fed paper in between, then you could read the dots or gaps or whatever in the in the punch card feeding through. And so people were writing programs on the punch cards to submit to them, so they could run it through their system to load onto their badge.\nPaul Cutler 7:00\nThat’s amazing. So you came for the talks, and the talks that are on the main stage have been released to YouTube or most of them. So we’ll link to the ones that we talked about.\nTod Kurt 7:09\nSo they they recorded. So there there’s two tracks of talks happening simultaneously. And the one they’re both being recorded, the ones in the bigger stage are streamed live to YouTube. So if you can’t make it to Supercon, next time, I would say try to watch the streams live because they’re, it’s a really good, they’ve got a really good AV setup, they’ve got multiple camera angles, they’ve got a switcher that’s switching between the slides of the presenter, and that way you can kind of participate on social media with people if you can’t make it because, you know, really, the only reason why I made it is because I also live in Pasadena. Sure. But but they did record all the ones. And so there was a really good ones in the Design Lab stage, a smaller stage, but those weren’t streamed though, I think they will release those in a maybe a month or two. So watch for them as they kind of clean up and make a whole package of all the videos and I think that’s that’s going to come out at some point soon.\nPaul Cutler 8:01\nSo as we were preparing for the show, I was watching some of the videos and that there was one thing I learned was don’t judge a book by the cover a couple of the videos that I would not have watched because of the title that because I just personally didn’t find it interesting. You recommended and I found them to be the best ones of the bunch. So let’s start with the first one. Let’s talk about the DIY vacuum tubes from Nick.\nTod Kurt 8:22\nSo Nick Poole is a he was like one of the most cyberpunk looking fellows. I know he’s got these these awesome, like dark black Angular tattoos on his face and arms. It just looks amazing. And he’s got these these cool jackets and clothes that he wears that just makes him look something like something out of a out of a movie. It’s it’s just amazing. He’s a really nice guy. He does sort of like design, like like inventor experimentation at SparkFun. I think like he creates some of the new cutting edge stuff that SparkFun does. But he wanted to like I think he was playing around a whimsically wanting to like imagine a world where we humans missed the boat on semiconductors and started miniaturizing vacuum tubes. And so imagine this world sort of like maybe like in the Fallout universe where we have these surface mount vacuum tubes, and we’ve got because of a vacuum tube computers that are small and fit on a on your wrist or something. And so he’s like, Well, what’s the smallest vacuum tube I can make? And can I a normal human make vacuum tubes. And so in this whole sort of journey of what does it take to make vacuum tubes? Turns out, it’s hard. It’s not just pulling a vacuum and putting the glass envelope around it. There’s a bunch of stuff going on and so, so he made a vacuum tube, a little tiny one, and it has little Hackaday logo inside. It’s just beautiful.\nPaul Cutler 9:42\nHis journey was pretty amazing. He reached out to a number of commercial companies who wanted to sell him, you know, lots of 1000s of pieces is just trying to build a couple right. But he was able to get samples and you know, it was a really interesting story as as, as he went along on that journey\nTod Kurt 10:00\nOne of the most interesting things is that there’s some sort of chemical that you put inside the vacuum tube. And when you like energize it or heat it up, that chemical vaporizes and plates onto the electrodes to make them appropriately doped to be the cathode and anode are something I didn’t fully, fully understand it because vacuum tubes man, there’s like this whole level of engineering and physics that we don’t really think about much anymore, because that was 50 years ago.\nPaul Cutler 10:31\nSo let’s talk about electric scooters, which was another kind of a journey talk or presentation that was given that I found fascinating.\nTod Kurt 10:38\nBradley growth he’s on he’s on social media is a tall, dark, and we really think he works with Shaw and conservative by doing like these really interesting environmental sensing platforms that can go out into the rough and tumble world. And since the world in various chemical and environmental waste, he also is a real big fan of personal electric vehicles or Utrecht scooters, it’s it’s a really interesting journey through the fact that, oh, there’s a lot of bad actors, like the bird scooter company, and things that are just like taking this interesting idea of a small electric scooter and polluting our environment with him. Just just tripping, like if you walk down a modern city nowadays, you have to trip over these dang scooters that have been abandoned. But there’s all this open source efforts to make them usable by normal people not locked into any one corporation. And there’s a single person he he talked about that is making open source firmware for these electronic speed controls and all the various critical electronics to control and deal with the charge of the scooter. And he ended his talk with one of the best sort of call to actions of, you know, like this guy doing this open source control, or in keeping keeping us or we’re not locked in to this world of bird is making a difference. And every one of us in the audience, watching that video can make a difference if we just care about one thing enough to like, you know, to work on it. So it was very inspirational. It’s.\nPaul Cutler 12:07\nAnd that was his message was find a community, join it and start a fight as he put it, right. He didn’t mean a literal fight. But he’s like, get engaged. And yes, it’s a great talk. If you do watch it stick to the end. So you can see that piece. You’ll learn a lot about personal electric vehicles, a lot of stuff I didn’t know. But you’re right. That end was just a kicker. It was great.\nTod Kurt 12:28\nYeah, I’ve I’ve never been interested much in scooters. But I do find the the study of them interesting, because it’s this type of electronics. It’s like high current electronics that I never deal with, like all the the chunks I deal with. They’re like in the orders of 10s of milliamps. And here’s like, you have to deal with potentially 50 100 million milliamps on these scooters, or just any electric vehicle. And it’s just it’s just a different way of thinking about electronics, which I find really fascinating. And then on top of it, his call to action.\nPaul Cutler 12:59\nThe next one I wanted to ask you about was Sammys random walk exploration. So I watched the video on this one as well. And he starts off, I’ll let you tell the story. But he starts off in one place and ends in another and it’s just a great story. It’s just this delightful\nTod Kurt 13:15\neffect he ended up creating at the conference, if you’re just running to Sammy, it looked like he was wearing this sort of crystal pendant around his neck. But he would sort of surreptitiously flip a switch. And suddenly that crystal pendant would start to glow with a sort of neon like glow. And you’d ask him what is that he’s like, it’s my breath. It’s in this and what that was is a a super thin flexible tesla coil that his that is under his shirt. So it’s probably something you shouldn’t wear if you’re if you have a pacemaker. And then that the crystal little like pendant isn’t is actually a glass and fuel that’s holding that is holding is a little evacuated chamber, sort of like a vacuum tube that is holding his breath. And that’s sitting on top of the tesla coil and you know, Tesla coils can ignite neon tubes. So it’s basically acting like a little neon tube. The semis got an amazing curiosity about the world. And he just was like, going through and learning about stuff and came across, like came onto this very beautiful piece of art. Yeah, he\nPaul Cutler 14:21\nshared his journey starting with a big vacuum pump everything from you know, making ice cream and it’s in a vacuum because Right, right the pressure and the temperature. He talks about how he, how he was looking for people who could train them in some of the glassblowing techniques. I believe it was, yes, yeah. And travels to Milwaukee. And just based on an email when he finally found someone shows up at her house knocks on the door. She’s not there. He’s like I’ve already paid Peter for the training. I have a plane ticket to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the middle of winter where it’s freezing and she’s not there. So he calls her Of course she transposed to the numbers. she’s, you know, 10 houses down this demonstrate. But it was it was engaging, it was great. And it was really interesting, like you said his curiosity of how he went from project to project to project to get to that end result that, you know, first ever wearable tesla coil was pretty cool.\nTod Kurt 15:14\nYeah, the challenge both both at Sammy and Nick had of how do you pull a vacuum of a volume of stuff something it’s, you get these vacuum pumps, you might see those will take you down to like maybe 1/10 or 100 atmospheric pressure. But if you need something that’s like really a vacuum, that’s hard, you get these really weird pumps that can kill themselves if you have a little bit of tiny impurities in the air that’s running through them. And so it’s a level of technique and technology that is just amazing.\nPaul Cutler 15:45\nThe last one, I wanted to ask you about the videos not out yet because it was on the Design Lab stage. But tell me about Chris combs talk.\nTod Kurt 15:51\nSo Chris combs is a artist who makes Blinky art things. It’s like really refined versions of things that you’ve seen a lot of people do. But it’s it actually, he’s actually thinking about it from an artistic point of view. And he’s in dialogue with a lot of the other artists and he has taken the time to actually figure out how do you integrate this kind of technical art into normal art museums or art galleries. And so he’s worked with these galleries, trying to get them to understand trying to figure out that like, Oh, this is a thing that needs to be plugged in, you know, the pictures on a wall. So don’t have you don’t have power requirements. But his his talk was, was really about you know how to sell your art, like, if you a lot of us make cool little things, and we want to like maybe maybe this would be useful just show off to people in an artistic way, it was also really nice to have this talk to a lot of people who might not consider the things they are making art. It’s like, but we all create all this stuff all the time. And so you know, what, why don’t you think of this as art, you know, you just have to kind of recontextualize some of your creations and start to talk to other people who are doing similar things. And then it’s art, you know, and but a lot of galleries don’t quite know how to do this sort of stuff yet. And it’s hard. And so so he he had like this nice sort of how to guide on most of like, what to do, how to look for the galleries, there are minimal how to talk to them, when when you find places how to not give up how to, like present your pieces so that they are actually people that actually want to bring them in on an unknown gallery and me and like how much to charge for them. You know, how many do you want to make of a thing? Do you want to make just one of the thing? Or maybe you know, it’s probably actually better if you make like, say 20 of a thing? Because then it because then it’s a limited series, you know, people like limited series, they’re able to say, Oh, look, I’m I’m four of 20. So it was really nice, because because a lot of the a lot of my cohort, I feel are have art tendencies. But there’s no real path like who do you talk to, you can’t just like, go to the Getty Art Museum and say, Hey, hang my Blinky thing on the wall.\nPaul Cutler 17:58\nRight? This is our to\nTod Kurt 18:01\ndo but he presents a way that you can start the process of getting, if you want to express yourself more publicly, I found that really nice, especially for the for the crowd, that the super con is. That’s\nPaul Cutler 18:13\ngreat. And speaking of the crowd, this was the first time since 2019. And the pandemic started that the that SuperCam was in person. How was it to be back in person at a conference like that?\nTod Kurt 18:23\nIt was really nice, but I am so out of practice being amongst crowds of people. It was it was very strange, because a lot of these people I see only on the internet, I see only via video calls. I don’t I just chats on social media. I don’t really see them in real life except during these these types of conferences. And so it was very strange, because some of these people I had not seen since 2019. And it was and because the last time I saw them wasn’t super con. It was almost as if nothing had happened in the last three years. It’s like, hey, it’s nice to see you again. You know, I just saw you last week. Well, I mean, not last week, but you know, last week for your three years\nPaul Cutler 18:59\nago. That’s pretty cool that you can just pick up from where you were. Yeah.\nTod Kurt 19:02\nBut it was super exhausting for me, because I’m just not used to I’m always tired out by by lots of people and Ted, like have gone for like three years not really being around people. And then suddenly, people,\nPaul Cutler 19:14\nI bet. Well, thanks for taking the time to share how Supercon went.\nTod Kurt 19:18\nThanks. Yeah, it’s really great. I recommend anybody or everybody who’s interested in this kind of stuff. Go to the academic comm site. Look for Supercon links. We’ll have a bunch in our show notes about the stuff you’ve been talking about. And when the videos come out, watch them. They’re almost all like super, super useful and super fun. Yeah,\nPaul Cutler 19:36\nthey did a great job picking out speakers. Great. Well, we’ll each leave you with one other news item this episode. My first one is Python in the browser. So if you think back to PyCon back this past April, the CEO of Anaconda Peter Wang announced pi script in PI script allows you to run Python in the browser using PI iodide. Pi iodide takes C Python and compiles it down to a web assembly. So you can use it as in a browser. The challenge is, is that’s about an 11 meg download. Right? We complain about large JavaScript downloads today. Well, 11, Meg’s isn’t gonna fly. What’s pretty cool is they were able to replace C Python with micro Python and get that down to 300k, which is way smaller than a lot of JavaScript libraries. py script is a framework that you build on top of pi iodide. And now you just use the target of micro Python instead. And now you can use Python right there in the browser, no JavaScript needed. I’m pretty excited about it. I use Python on the server side for a couple of my websites. But now you’ll be able to reuse code. In my personal opinion pythons a little easier to learn than JavaScript. And imagine that we can do that and how we can enable the education system using you know, cheaper computers, or if it’s in a web browser, you can use mobile devices, it’s you know, the possibilities are endless. Now, with that said, there’s a lot of excitement, you can see my excitement, but it’s still really, really early. Everything I’ve read talks about that. And there’s a great podcast this week, listen to the talk Python podcast with Michael Kennedy. He’s got guests, including Brett cannon, Fabio plugger. And Nicholas taller Bay, who was on the circuit Python show earlier this year was was a fantastic guest. But they go into the technical details of it. So if you want to learn more, listen to that. And sometime in the next year or two, I’m excited to see what pi script is gonna really look like in a browser.\nTod Kurt 21:27\nYeah, it’s so crazy to you look at some of the postscript examples. And it’s like, oh, it’s during the year sort of like basic sort of here’s how to do some initial little little web, like dynamic web things, either view source, and that’s like your standard web you things of like linking to CSS and HTML body, and then the PI script tag, and then Python,\nPaul Cutler 21:47\na pure Python I’m where it really gets exciting if you think about it, not just education. But if you can include the data science tools like NumPy and SCI pi, yeah, right in a browser where you can just show and manipulate them that could be pretty exciting. What is your last item for us today?\nTod Kurt 22:02\nIt’s a Tod-tastic episode this this episode.\nPaul Cutler 22:06\nDidn’t have it any other way.\nTod Kurt 22:08\nI guess in August, I made this little gizmo called the PICO step seek, which is a tiny MIDI step sequencer. Using these eight levers switches that have built in LEDs that are they’re very popular on synthesizers and drum machines and 1980s Adafruit, I just started carrying them. And two weeks before circuit Python day, I was like, I’m gonna see if I can build a sequencer using these switches and a Raspberry Pi Pico and a little OLED display and a rotary encoder, and I’m gonna like design the PCB get it fam to write the firmware in circuit Python and design a little 3d printed case for it that looks very at style. And I did it I was kind of surprised it all it all just kind of fell together, I didn’t make any major mistakes on the PCB. And the circuit was pretty simple. So it was there’s a few things to mess up on the circuit Python was really quick to implement the ideas even though the timing for doing MIDI is a little, a little loose in circuit Python, because there’s no way of doing like things on a specific clock. But it worked. The description of hold of that is now an article in The Magpie magazine which is the sort of official magazine of the Raspberry Pi foundation and so it’s both on their website and in their print version. I’m very excited I was trying to find how have we get a version of this this magazine in the in California like is there a way and I I couldn’t find a way so I ordered one from their website in England I’ll be getting at some point a physical magazine all the way from the UK\nPaul Cutler 23:39\nto I get to tease you that they called you an expert in micro Python and that circuit Python\nTod Kurt 23:44\nYeah, it’s it’s it has hilarious because I know so little about micro Python because they’re they’re actually quite different if anyone has not played with either. There’s a lot of overlap. But yeah, there’s there’s enough difference that it’s hard to know sometimes what’s going on. It’s like check\nPaul Cutler 23:58\nout the magpie you can read the article online. Also check out John parks workshop, the November 30 episode where he demoed one radon video so you can see it in here.\nTod Kurt 24:09\nYeah, we’ll have that we’ll have that link in the show notes to jump mark is another call up because it was his little demo of the steps switches, that levers switches that made me go hmm, I wonder if I can make a sequencer so it was like like a week previous? It was his what does he call it? John parks pic of the Week show that made me go haha.\nPaul Cutler 24:30\nGotta get your inspiration from anywhere you can.\nTod Kurt 24:32\nThat’s right. But Oh, also, the magpie magazine is totally free as a PDF download. If you want to get the print version in PDF form, you can donate to them because they are finishing one. But\nPaul Cutler 24:43\nyeah, I recommend it. Well, that’s that’s our show. It was very Tod tastic. Thanks for listening. can follow us on Twitter at the bootloader or look for us on mastodon.

Simple and clean, with what you need: code editor + terminal window Works with any MicroPython device with USB serial, from my limited testing No serial plotter, no library manager, no board manager. This is a first step However, it is yet-another-Electron app, so it’s fairly pudgy memory-wise Alternatives: Thonny – beloved by many. I do not like it, find it unattractive and confusing Mu – cleaner and has a nice serial plotter like Arduino IDE Any text editor + picotool – my preferred choice What I do not recommend: any “micropython extension” for VS Code/Atom/etc. The ones I’ve tried are flaky and presume too much, taking over other Python projects Home Assistant and the State of the Open Home (Paul #1) Home automation platform focused on local control and privacy No vendor log-in Your smart home shouldn’t require the cloud State of the Open Home is an annual look at the smart home ecosystem and Home Assistant Livestreamed Nov 13, 2022 #2 open source project on Github by contributor contributions Home Assistant Cloud from Nabu Casa processed 50,000 webhooks per second 190,000 instances of HA opted in to reporting Estimated 500,000 - 600,000 installations of HA 2023: Year of Voice Rhasspy voice assistant: https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy by Michael Hansen Can function completely disconnected from the Internet Are entirely free/open source with a permissive license (MIT) Works well with freely available home automation software Optimized for working with MQTT, HTTP and Websockets with Home Assistant having built in support Support for over 25 different languages Hired by Nabu Casa to work on and integrate Rhasspy full-time Summary video WithDiode.com – 3d breadboard simulation in the browser (Tod #2) omg. this is the best. so fun Created by Kennth Cassel (who also created a nice Vim tutorial site called vim.so I saw it first from Clive Thompson (@clive@saturation.social) on Mastodon I was able to implement some of the oscillators we did during Deep Fried Neurons DeepFriedNeurons breadboard oscillators But… it’s actually kinda harder to use than real breadboards Other tools I find useful in this space: Wokwi simulator lets you simulate Arduino, Micropython, and CircuitPython Fritzing lets you visually breadboard up circuits, with accompanying breadboard \u0026 PCB layout GitHub in the news (Paul #2) Follow-up: the investigation has spawned a GitHub Copilot lawsuit Verge Hey Github Imagine being able to code hands free This could be big for accessibility Use natural speech, for example: Saying “Import pandas” results in import pandas as pd In the features, Github shares: Write / edit code (using GitHub Copilot) Go to the next method with code navigation (“Hey GitHub go to line 34 or method X) Run the program and control your IDE using any VS Code command Code Summarization: Ask “Hey GitHub!” to explain lines 3-10 and get a summary of what the code does RNBO “rainbow” – Turn Max patches into VST plugins (Tod #3) Ever wonder how people make virtual synths / audio effects, or even real synths \u0026 effects? Max is a way to create custom virtual instruments or effects, and custom UI. Make it look like a real thing if you want Max is often a good solution to mocking up ideas for these, kinda like CircuitPython and Arduino is for microcontroller projects Max is a stand-alone application or part of Ableton Live It’s what’s called a “patching environment”, a “nodes \u0026 flows” graphical programming tool The “flows” are audio \u0026 MIDI, kinda like modular synths cabling stuff together I’ve used in on-n-off (mostly off) since the 90s (could never quite get into it) But Max patches have to live inside Max (or inside Max in Live) RNBO let’s you create a “compilable” versions of Max patch It is inclucded with Max or $299 for permanent license or $10/month subscription RNBO is actually a parallel thing to Max, but implements most all of Max But does Turns any Max patch into a C++-based stand-alone VST Can even target Raspberry Pi, so you can make custom Pi-based synths \u0026 pedals Or can export to Web Audio, with Javascript control! good CDM article about RNBO good synthanatomy article too about why this is cool Online (paid) class for how to use it by Music Hackspace Here’s a preview on youtube Open source alternative to Max is PureData (aka ‘Pd’) Pd \u0026 Max have common roots, Pd is a bit rougher looking than Max, but very capable And it runs on a Raspberry Pi And there’s a huge community of existing Pd patches.

This is Episode Five. The show works like this. Todd and I each have brought three things to share with you. We’ll spend a few minutes talking about each but no more than five. If you want to learn more, we have detailed show notes available at the bootloader dotnet. And give us a follow on Twitter at the bootloader while Twitter is still alive, Todd, why don’t you get us started?\nTod Kurt 0:25\nAll right, so Arduino and micro Python. What? If you like, watch the Arduino blog at all, you might have seen that there is a micro Python IDE that was put out by Arduino labs. So it’s not by Arduino inspired, we know Labs, which is kind of this new thing that they’ve created. And it works. It’s just a short answer that works. If you if you play with micro Python, and you want to give it a give it a try. Go ahead and try it out. It’s basically like a very simplified version of what you get with these other things like Thani and mu. It’s very clean icons very, very well designed. And it looks very usable. It’s not restricted to just the micro Python boards that are doing the cells, it seems to work with any micro Python device. And it’s basically just two windows, your code editor and a little like serial terminal slash repple window on top of each other. The code editor has syntax highlighting kind of like like what you’d expect. And so it’s your it’s your basic like no frills, just like let’s get going. And so that’s the good part. The bad part is that it’s because it’s such a first step. It’s just the editor and the repple. If you start doing Oh, you’re used to things like library managers and board managers and a serial plotter things that help you sort of manage a larger project. And there’s none of that. There’s really not much of that in the micro Python world anyway. So you know, so it’s not really that much of a mess. Also, it’s an electron app. This is one of the reasons why I think they’re able to put it out so quickly, this electron app, which is this web framework, you can use to write web pages that are that act like desktop applications for multiple platforms, I use it a lot, it’s really great. But it is essentially another version of Chrome on your desktop. And you already probably have a couple of other electron apps on your desktop as well like discord and slack and all this other stuff, because that’s pretty much our iOS as they’re turning into just glorified browser runners. And, and the problem with electron apps is they’re usually pretty big, because because browsers are very complex beasts. And there’s a lot of stuff in there. And it’s really hard to pare them down because of because of the just the nature of how web browsers work. And so it’s pretty big, you know, like we need the download is like 180 meg or something to have it takes a couple of seconds to start up. You think like, oh, it’s such a simple program, we should just kind of instantly it’s like, well, it could and so yeah, go and try it out. If you’ve never played around with it ease for for micro Python, there’s a couple others that are things to look at a few here into this one’s called Thani th O N and why it’s seen as B to be loved by a lot of people, I find it an attractive and confusing. And others mu m u, it’s a much cleaner interface, it seems to be trying to try to be most like Arduino for micro Python or circuit Python, it’s got a very good serial plotter, which is really handy because a lot of times it microcontroller projects you like want to just read a sensor and spit out a bunch of values and kind of see what the shape of those values look like. And so on Arduino, you just do like serial dot print and the number and then you open up a serial plotter and you get a command called Graph. Mu has that also.\nPaul Cutler 3:18\nAnd Mu just came out with a new version 1.12 was released just this past Sunday.\nTod Kurt 3:22\nThat’s right. Yeah, cuz there’s been some changes with circuit Python, which it also supports where circuit Python can give you like this meta information about the Wi Fi network it’s connected to and other kinds of in the version and stuff and so mute can accurately track that and display it nicely for you. But my preferred choice all these IDs, I’m not really IDE guy, I use a text editor. And I use pico tool, which is the command line tool that Raspberry Pi makes to let you inspect and copy files and twiddle with your Raspberry Pi pico that’s running micro Python. I don’t really play with micro Python on other boards, much like there’s a if you’re doing like the ESP based micro Python, there’s like a web repple that kind of does similar stuff. And there’s cool things that hook into that. I know nothing about that. What I do not recommend if you’re into micro Python is any of these like extensions for VS code, or atom or whatever. The ones I’ve tried, they just kind of screw up your VS code install and kind of pollute, you’re doing normal Python stuff. I don’t know if it’s just my inexperience with this world, in my kind of general distaste for most IDs, but I would say just go ahead and use mu or Thani or this new micro Python binary we know it seems to work well.\nPaul Cutler 4:29\nI read four or five different stories talking about this launch of micro Python on Arduino. And like you said it’s Arduino labs. So it’s their experimental arm of Arduino. Is Arduino committing to anything? Are they saying that all their boards going forward will be micro Python compatible as well? Are they trying to make it more of a first class citizen or is it is it still do you think just in that experimental stage,\nTod Kurt 4:51\nI think it’s purely just an experiment like there’s there’s a lot of a lot of noise, a lot of press around micro Python and circuit Python. On and Arduino doesn’t really want to be left out, I think and, and they see a lot of their customers moving to a simpler way of doing microcontroller things like in the same way that Arduino was a really simplified way of dealing with microcontrollers. 15 years ago, instead of setting up the BSP and the custom IDE that was made by the vendor, the chip vendor that had not had no knowledge of your particular board, you can just install Arduino. And you could get to blinking an LED in five minutes versus like a whole week that it would take you normally that sort of simplicity that are doing a promised you still want. But now our expectations of what simple is has gotten a lot higher, like now we want really high level languages like micro Python, or like there’s these embedded Java scripts and stuff now. And so I think this is just them kind of playing around and seeing and seeing how far they can go. Like let’s see what is micro Python do for us. And there are some some of our customers might want to use it. And because Arduino has gotten really into industrial, like sort of commercial embedded stuff. It’s really funny. They’ve they moved away in a lot in a lot of cases from the original teaching tool that are doing it was like now they’ve got some really serious boards that can run like almost a full OS. And so in that case, you know, a really high level language makes a lot more sense.\nPaul Cutler 6:14\nThats of good one. My first one this week is home assistant, we had mentioned home assistant and passing in a past episode when we talked about the matter, smart home standard that was just finalized. Well, home assistant is matter compatible. On November 13th, they hosted a state of the open home live stream, where they took a look back at everything home assistant has done for the last year where the market has gone, they talked a little bit about matter, then they also look forward to what’s coming next year, what did they want to work on. So if you haven’t played around with home assistants, it’s really a home automation platform focused on local control and privacy. There’s no vendor lock in, it works with matter. It works with ZigBee, and Z wave. There’s something like 1900 different integrations for hardware and software that it can play around with. It’s absolutely amazing. It was the second most contributed to GitHub repository in the past year, which I thought was interesting. Second only to VS code. So it shows you how many different people are actually submitting their different integrations that they’ve done 190,000 instances of homelessness and have opted into telemetry reporting. And they estimate that there’s probably 500 to 600,000 Total installations of a home assistant out in the wild. That’s pretty darn impressive for an open source and free software project.\nTod Kurt 7:29\nYeah, and especially for one that’s not that easy to get going like it’s a Raspberry Pi thing, which is like already kind of a barrier to a lot of people. And I think you can run it on a desktop computer. But all the real installations I’ve seen have been on on Raspberry Pi’s.\nPaul Cutler 7:42\nYeah, it’s really recommended to run on a Raspberry Pi. Looking forward, they have declared that 2023 will be the year of voice. I gotta give them credit, they looked at where home assistant is they looked at the other platforms. And that’s one area where they’re not quite up to par with some of the competition out there, whether it’s Alexa or Google or Siri. So they’ve hired Michael Hanson, who is the lead developer of the recipe voice assistant, which is has a lot of similarity to home assistant can function offline. It’s entirely free and open source under a permissive MIT license can be run disconnected from the internet. And it works well with home assistant already, though it could be some of those integrations could be improved. It’s optimized to work with MQ, tt, and HTTP and some WebSockets and supports over 25 different languages already. That’s going to be pretty cool. When you start thinking about those low cost ESP devices just added my microphone, customize your wake word. And now you can place those little microphones all over the home, especially with those ESPs having Wi Fi connectivity.\nTod Kurt 8:45\nThat’s really cool. I was watching some of the videos on on the raspy that’s our h a s s p y is a nice little nice little play on the a raspy voice and Raspberry Pi. And it listens to work really well. And it’s doing it all locally. Like although all these other voice assistants well, even even Siri to a large degree, it uploads essentially your voice wav file to some cloud service you have no control over and who knows where what’s it what it’s doing with that audio. We’re now this is all like in total your control totally on your network. You cannot be not even connected to the network and have it work. You know, if you wanna do a totally local install, that’s That’s amazing. I don’t have any home. I don’t have any voice based things in my house because of this. I don’t I don’t trust them. And so this all this URL I’d like to try out.\nPaul Cutler 9:31\nI don’t either and I’m right there with you. I did. I did back a Kickstarter a couple years ago from Microsoft, which is finally shipping after years of delays. And I’m hoping that I can try raspy on it. It already has some kind of voice assistant built in. But being open source I’m sure I can probably swap it out. What’s your next one?\nTod Kurt 9:49\nHave you ever read boarded up little electric circuits? Yeah, you get little little grid of holes and you stick components in the holes and you like make LEDs blink with transistors and resistors In capacitors, it says a lot of fun. There’s a problem though with that, and that’s that you have to have those things. There’s this cool little website called with diode.com and created by this guy named Kenneth Castle, who also created this really interesting little vim tutorial if you want to learn the VIM editor. I first saw this announced by Clive Thompson on mastodon. The with DataCite is a breadboard and electrical circuit simulator. So you take like little wires and you plug them into the breadboard holes and you take a little resistors and plug them into the holes next to the wires and transistors. And you can make a little blinking LED and it’s got a little virtual battery pack you plug on you need to choose where on the breadboard holes that things can be plugged in. It’s all it’s all in 3d. So you can like spin the breadboard around to see it for different angles, which is really handy because it’s easy to get lost in kind of the nest of wires and a breadboard as you start to add. Make a circuit any complexity. I played with it for a cut for like half an hour and is able to implement some of the little oscillator circuits that me Carlin and Barb Noren made in early 2020, we had this little YouTube Twitch show called Deep fried neurons, where we got together once a week and we talked about and did little projects and a couple of weeks of projects were little transistor oscillators, each of us breadboard it up and try to do something creative creative with it. And this is really common oscillator called a multi Estevan multivibrator, which is two transistors and essentially two capacitors a couple of resistors. And with that you kind of slosh charge back and forth between the two capacitors using the transistors to blink LEDs. And this little simulator thing can do it with diode can can simulate all that. And you can actually change the values of the resistors and get the blinking to change and have it be a fade instead of a blink. And, and it’s pretty neat. I must say it’s kind of fascinating to see what’s possible in the browser. Nowadays. It’s just like every time you see one of these crazy crazy 3d things in the browser just blows me away. The problem. There’s a problem though with it. And that breadboard is actually kind of hard to use if you’ve never come across them before. So at first I was thinking, Oh, this might be a really great way to teach breadboards to someone who doesn’t have a breadboard. It’s better than not having anything with to teach. But I think there’s this extra level of obfuscation of having it be this still a 3d object in a browser window where if it was with a real breadboard, you can grab it and look at it and sort of poke around. But it’s harder to do that the 3d virtual environment also I think they missed a trick where one of the things I’ve noticed when I’ve taught electronics is how to teach people to learn what the different rows of the breadboards rows, like how they’re connected, like these rows are connected, but these columns are not connected and and the two rows are in parallel, but they’re not connected to each other. And so trying to try to explain that and get them students to understand that is hard. And they could have highlighted that somehow in the simulator, which they don’t do yet. And this is like a very new project. So maybe it’ll be changed to do that. That’s what doubt if you’re looking for things that are kind of like this but but different on different axes. I’m a real fan of this thing called the walkway simulator, it’s wo K wi is aimed at letting you simulate Arduino projects and micro Python circuit Python. And so you can run little versions of the Raspberry Pi Pico and you can like load an Arduino sketch onto it and have it you know, blink. It’s got virtual buttons and virtual pots and virtual LEDs and stuff and LEDs and LCDs. There’s also if you want to like just visualize a breadboard circuit there’s fritzing fri tz i ng it’s good for just drawing up a breadboard circuit it actually knows, knows about the conductivity of a breadboard, so it’ll let you kind of teach you how breadboards work. And the bonus of that is that also while you’re wiring things up on the breadboard, it’s also wiring them up in a schematic view if you want to look at that. So you can then switch over to schematic view and kind of clean up the layout. And so oh look, I’ve got now a schematic of the thing. I just breadboard it. So yeah, so that’s with diode, I recommend checking it out. It’s at least fun for an afternoon.\nPaul Cutler 13:53\nAnd that’s exactly what it was. I hadn’t heard of it until you shared it. And I was playing around with it. And the next thing I know probably a half hour went by and I hit you know, I had all these different things placed it was it was just a ton of fun.\nTod Kurt 14:06\nOkay, so what’s what’s your number two this week,\nPaul Cutler 14:08\nI wanted to talk about GitHub again. But as a quick follow up to my GitHub story from a couple episodes ago, that lawsuit investigation about GitHub co pilot, the AI pair programmer has been filed. So there is an actual class action lawsuit filed in the state of California for that. So it’ll be something to keep an eye on. I’ve linked to a couple of the news stories for that in the show notes. But if you like CO pilots, and you really believe in it as a solution, GitHub universe was held earlier this month, which is their annual conference developer conference. And one of the things that they debuted from GitHub labs, their experimental arm is Hey, GitHub, and it’s probably exactly what you think it is a voice assistant way to code. So imagine being able to code hands free. This could be huge for accessibility. I had minor hand surgery a couple of months ago and that was the first question I asked the doctor is can I type right away? Thankfully, I could, but for someone who can’t. What’s really neat about it is is it uses natural speech. If you’re creating a Python program using Pandas, for example, you can say import pandas. And the result will be import pandas as PD. So the program knows of the right way to actually import a library in Python, for example, a link to the demonstration that GitHub has on their page, but it’s pretty cool in the in the features that they show how you can write an edit code, which is using GitHub pilot behind the scenes, or GitHub copilot behind the scenes. You can say things like go to the next method with code navigation hit GitHub, go to Line 34, or hey, GitHub, go to method x, or, you know, one of the ones they call out that I thought was really cool was code summarization. Ask, hey, GitHub to explain lines three through 10. And get a summary of what that code does. Or you can actually just run a program and control your IDE using any VS code command, using your voice. When we start thinking about what the next generation of IDs are, like we were just talking about, this really takes that to that next level,\nTod Kurt 16:03\nthis is really fascinating, especially the explanation, capability, I would love it if copilot turns into an opt in thing where maybe it’s part of a new license. Like there’s a there’s a new MIT open source license that is MIT with, you know, AI, re constitution or whatever. Like this has a great a great benefit for pedagogical reasons like I need to understand code and have it talk to me, you know, I want to talk to the thing and I want to have a talk back to me. And you can kind of almost pair program with this AI just by using your voice which I think it’d be really interesting. I agree. Oh, also, I there was a guy I work with, like 20 years ago, who’s RSI was so bad, he had to hire a person to do all of his typing for him. And so he would sit there. And he’d have a essentially like, like an intern level person in front of him. And he just would like, say things to like, add this line at this line. And this was like, I think he was doing it on the C or C++. Over time here. This person clearly had the typing person had to be technically savvy enough to know how to use editors run compilers. But over time, they almost became like pair programming because the TypeR kind of knew what he would would want when he would say things like import pandas. And he would, he would fill out the entire syntactically correct thing to type.\nPaul Cutler 17:19\nAnd now you’re gonna have it as your AI pair programmer.\nTod Kurt 17:23\nYeah, that’s great. Um, this could be this could be a huge boon for people with accessibility issues, because I’ve I’ve had a few RSI issues, but it’s not been nearly as enough enough to make it so that it’s I just can’t type. Imagine if you just couldn’t tie it. That’d be terrible.\nPaul Cutler 17:37\nSo what’s your next one for us?\nTod Kurt 17:40\nHave you ever wondered how people make these virtual sense or audio effects that are in these audio programs? Like, you know, you’ve got your things that act like an old synthesizer, or they act like a like a guitar pedal? Or even even like real sense. How do you like how does one make a real big monitor synthesizer, one of the tools people use is this thing called Max or Maximus P. And it’s a graphical programming environment with these, I call it nodes and flows, you’ve got these boxes indicate a function, and then a line between the boxes indicate sort of data flow. And so one example might be, say, a box, that’s a WAV file, and a flow is the audio coming out of it. And then it’s going into another box that say a delay effect. And that’s going out to another box that say the output to your headphones. And then like the input to the very first wav box might be what pitch the wav file be played at. And that’s a MIDI flow, say to a keyboard. And so now you’ve just made a sampler press key on a keyboard that flows into the first box that starts the wave plane that goes into the delay effect that makes the wave go bump, bump, bump bump, you now made a little synthesizer. And so that’s what Max can do, you can just like go click a click Make a little boxes connecting together. And then you can put a custom UI on top of that, to make it look like whatever you want to get to. So if you’ve got a great idea for a new guitar pedal or a new synthesizer, you can have have your own knobs. And so you’re on graphic design. And all of this lives inside the Mac’s environment or it could live inside of say Ableton Live like a bit like Ableton Live includes Max’s as part of the thing. But the things you create have to always live inside of Max. I’ve used this off and on since like the 90s. There’s a long history of Max as a as a thing. It’s really kind of like looking the Wikipedia entry at some point for it is it’s got a really long and storied history. It’s it’s very fascinating. But just a few days ago, maybe last week, the company that makes Max 774 released our NBO or rainbow, which in short is a way of turning your max patches into VST plugins, ie you can like compile them down into a thing that you can then use in any other program that can do audio stuff. But it’s not just that it can also be compiled down to a thing that can run on a Raspberry Pi. Or it can be compiled down to a thing that runs in Web Audio on a webpage and can be controlled with JavaScript. And so the same sort of thing where you can make this like custom UI Audio Effect or audio generator, you can now run on like all these different systems, it’s kind of nuts. It’s like I’m so used to Mac’s being this little walled garden where you can make these amazing things, but they’re kind of stuck in the world of Mac’s. And now it’s you can kind of pull it out and let it be free.\nPaul Cutler 20:16\nYeah, if you can export to VST, you can put it into Logic Audacity is a recent release that just came out a couple of months ago uses VSTS for the first time ever. So that’s exciting.\nTod Kurt 20:27\nAll these all these video production things like OBS or Final Cut or whatever also can deal with VSTS I think there’s there’s even an online class you can buy from from the music Hackspace to teach you how to use r\u0026b Oh, now to be truthful, r\u0026b Rainbow isn’t exactly Max. It’s like kind of a parallel universe Max, because they had to make things. Max is a very text based, strangely very text based environment. And so they had to make some like sort of a Mirror Universe of the max objects to make them work in a purely sort of numeric way. But for the most part, you don’t really notice that you just kind of like copy the, the rainbow version of the max object you want to do use. And so if you’re a max person, it looked very comfortable. You just kind of like copy and paste and pretty much you’re done. But it is expensive is it’s a for pay thing. It’s like 300 bucks for permanent license or 10 bucks a month. If you just want to try it out and see how it works. It is independent of Mac’s, I believe, although if you buy Mac’s or rainbow comes with it. In fact, you can target Raspberry Pi’s are pretty cool, because normally Max only runs on Mac or Windows. Now if you’re like buy all this commercial software, I want something free. Good news. There’s this thing called pure data that’s been around as long as Macs because they are they come from the sort of the same source. And it’s the same sort of thing. It’s a graphical nodes and flows based programming language where you connect to other boxes with lines looks a little rougher, it’s open source looks a little rougher, but it runs everywhere runs on a Raspberry Pi. I think I had one that ran on my phone at one point. There’s also a huge community of patches already created in for PD, you can you can play with. I’ve only played with PD a little bit our hackerspace CrunchBase for a while had a PD, like a monthly PD meetup, where people in Los Angeles would get together and like talk about how to use peer data to like do stuff and one guy had a Raspberry Pi guitar pedal that you made out of using PD. Yeah, so it says this wasn’t like that this rainbow stuff is anything new per se. But it’s sort of new in the sense of like, here is this like big company that’s doing this sort of shiny version of this idea and making it so you can just have to go boom, here’s a VST of the thing. And it turns out there is even a compiler for PD patches and stuff that I just learned today. It’s called heavy and it’s an online thing. I’ve not tried it out yet. But apparently you can compile down PD patches in a similar way to what rainbow is doing. I don’t know how it works. I might try it out after the show. But\nPaul Cutler 22:42\ntry it out and report back.\nTod Kurt 22:44\nExactly right. All right. So what’s so what’s our final thing for today?\nPaul Cutler 22:49\nOur final one is just a couple of quick links about Mastodon so we joked at the top of the show that Twitter’s dying and it’s it’s you know, it’s sad for me it’s actually the the one social media that I kind of liked. Yep. So I’m sad to see it go and I’m sad to see it implode in real time. So you and I are some of the ones that have made the migration over to Mastodon and Mastodon is different than Twitter. So for people who are thinking that it’s just going to be a Twitter clone, that’s not what it is. So the first article is hope for a post Musk net. So that really talks about the federated nature of Mastodon and how it’s decentralized. So it’s a really good primer for that. The next two articles one from Sage sharp and one from Summa, both talked about how important it is to do a little research about which instance which server you want to join, to understand, do they have any technical problems in the past? What kind of speech do they offer? Who are the admins and how many admins and what’s the uptime and those kinds of things. So just things to put in the back of your head if you’re thinking about joining Mastodon, and if you are the last two articles, one from Les pounder at Tom’s Hardware in one at Wired from Justin pod are both how to move from Twitter to Mastodon and how to get started. So good articles. I’m enjoying Mastodon I like the fact that I can follow hashtags, for example, makes it easy to follow along to a couple of different topics. But it’s not Twitter in nor should you expect it to be Twitter\nTod Kurt 24:12\nor Hackerspace. Back in 2018 when there’s the other sort of big kerfuffle with Twitter, a lot of us started moving to mastodons or see if we could move to Mastodon me and Carlin set up a crush space Mastodon instance server just to see if we could see how hard it would be. And it turns out it’s pretty easy to set up your own Mastodon server it’s even easier now because there’s a what do you call it a hosting service called Mastodon dot host or something where you pay him like six bucks a month and they’ll just like maintain your Mastodon server for you and you can just have your own. You know, if you want to have Paul Cutler at flippy dot pizza, you know, as your Mastodon handle, you can have that. It turns out there’s a couple of different management issues. Well, I guess the the hosting the hosting service solves the one the big management issue which is keeping things updated, you know, so it’s not like, you know, like anything on the internet It has to be continuously updated. Yeah, there’s this sort of political management of like, one of the things with Macedon Federation is that the servers talk to each other. There’s no one central server. And servers can have opinions about other servers, like, Oh, there’s the server full of full of, you know, all the rude jerks. Let’s just like not federate with them, you can just choose to do that blink, and you just remove them from your feed, you can do that on a personal basis, like I could do it, you could do it, but the server admin can just make the decision. You know what, I think we should just not even allow any of these people to even see our users really. And if you have users on your system that aren’t you, you then maybe have to make that decision. For for the group, you know, right. And so we because of these management issues, we ended up turning off the crash base incidents, it might be time to revisit that. Nowadays, I would say pretty much pick one of the ones that that the mastodon, the join method. Org recommends to you, they’re all pretty good. They’re all pretty well maintained by people that will keep them up and have sort of good ability to, to keep out the creeps\nPaul Cutler 26:11\nto manage a server, which is a challenge. There’s too many internet trolls out there.\nTod Kurt 26:15\nYeah, it’s been really fun to sort of like experience the net the way it was almost back when I first joined Twitter back in 2006. As I was, I didn’t really have a need for it back then I’ve been really enjoying Twitter, these last couple of years, I felt like they’ve really had started to hit, hit a good stride on how to make the product get better. And it’s just kind of tears me up that like it’s going oh, it just seems to be going away very fast.\nPaul Cutler 26:38\nI’m right there with you. So anyway,\nTod Kurt 26:41\nI’m at Todd bought at Mastodon dot social.\nPaul Cutler 26:45\nPR Cutler at Foster dawn.org. So I went with one of the free and open source ones. It also lets me put little cool emojis after my name. So I’ve got a little Python emoji after my very glum, which is one of the things the server’s can do is have custom emoji. So it’s, it’s really easy to look at the API calls for that off to put a link into a couple of those as well.\nTod Kurt 27:05\nIf you’re worried about joining a mastodon instance of SQL Server, just join one, it’s kind of like, you know, email addresses, like some people really care that they’ve got at my custom domain name.com. And some people just don’t care they and they will just use@gmail.com. And so you can use one of the big Macedon servers if you want,\nPaul Cutler 27:23\nand they make it a breeze to switch servers. So don’t feel like that you’re locked into one once you choose it. Yeah, I’m\nTod Kurt 27:29\non my I think fourth server and you can just move all your followers over and all your old posts on the old server still stay. And so it’s not like you’re deleting anything. Nothing really lets you explicitly delete it. So yeah, I would say just try it out and see what happens.\nPaul Cutler 27:42\nSo give us a follow on mastodon. That’s our show.

Matter is an open standard for smart home IoT stuff (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc all signed on) Matter 1.0 spec just released (stared in 2019) Created by what was the Zigbee Alliance (Zigbee being a BLE-like protocol from a decade ago) Matter, however, sits on top of existing WiFi or BLE protocols Most examples I’ve seen are WiFi-based IOS 16.1 now just sees them Matter was originally called Project CHIP, why their github org is named ‘project-chip’, Eric from ThatProject Youtube channel demos it Eric also posted to reddit in r/esp32 Their Github repo has useful ESP32-based examples ThatProject Eric also has a great Github Repo of ESP32 IoT projects 3D printing for good causes (Paul #2) 7:00 3D Printing for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Campaign The idea was started by a teacher, Abby Brown, at Torrey Pines High School. Each year the school has Yellow Ribbon week where students are learn about crisis resources and risk factors for suicide. The keychains were designed to give away to her students as a special way to end Yellow Ribbon Week. Each keychain contains a word, such as “Smile”, “Inspire”, “Create”, with about 10 different words. There’s a fundraising campaign where you can print one of the designs found on Cults3D and post it on Twitter and Instagram. Different organizations are matching the funds, with an opportunity to raise over $4000 by just printing and sharing! Joel Telling, Printed Solid, LDO Motors, and Alien3D [https://www.ic3dprinters.com/2022-toys/](3D Printed Toys for Tots campaign) Organized by IC3D in 2018, they work with volunteers in the 3D printing community to print toys for kids Over 69,000 toys printed in 2021!

You can donate financially or sign up to help print toys Toys include an articulated alligator, a train engine, cars, low poly dinosaurs, and more. The signup period is now over to volunteer for printing, but keep an eye out for this next year. Twitch.tv Stream Hypno “video synthesizer” from Sleepy Circuits (Tod #2) 10:00 Have you ever taken a camcorder and point it at the TV to get weird video feedback? Have you ever enjoyed those trippy algorithmic screen savers? You can do both in real-time with devices called “video synthesizers” I was at Synthplex last weekend and it was fun! It’s mostly a audio synth convention but there were a few non-audio things there too, like: Hypno by Sleepy Circuits is one such device Physically it’s a small box with knobs, sliders, and buttons. And an HDMI port! (and NDI over USB for streaming) Twiddle the knobs \u0026 sliders to create generative video patterns Source material can be video “oscillators”, camera feeds, video files Raspberry Pi 3 or 4-based, with Eurorack-compatible jacks to sync to your music Been in development since 2019 Extensive documentation and a big community, with an active forum (Product page](https://sleepycircuits.com/hypno) Example videos on Instagram IO Rodeo Launches the Open Colorimeter, a CircuitPython Analysis Tool for Citizen Science - Hackster.io (Paul #3) 13:10 Hackster.io article from Gareth Halfacree The Open Colorimeter is an instrument with many applications, including measuring contaminants \u0026 pollutants in soil \u0026 water Based on the Adafruit PyBadge 3D printed case Published under open licenses MIT for the firmware Physical designs under a CC-4.0 license Excellent documentation with product guides and project tutorials Example: measure the blue dye in sports drinks IO Rodeo’s mission is to increase accessibility to scientific data collection tools by creating low-cost, open hardware instrumentation.

I’m Paul Cutler.\nTod Kurt 0:04\nAnd I’m Tod Kurt. And this is episode four. The show works like this, Paul and I each have brought three things to share with you. We’ll spend a few minutes talking about each but no more than five. If you want to learn more, we have detailed show notes available at the bootloader dotnet. And give us a follow on Twitter at the bootloader. So Paul, why don’t you start us off this week.\nPaul Cutler 0:20\nSo the big one is probably the Mac OS Ventura was recently released, got a couple new features couple cool ones like continuity camera, but you can’t use finder to drag and drop you have to in hex files anymore, gives you a nice little error every time you try. Now, Adafruit and Raspberry Pi both have excellent blog posts on it. So I’m not going to spend any time going through the technical how I also would recommend watching the November 2 escan, engineer with Lady Ada, where she actually goes in does a great overview of how this happens. But there’s two workarounds for now one, you can drop down to a terminal and use the Copy command. The other one that I don’t think has got a lot of news is that Alistair Allen, the author of the Raspberry Pi blog post that I mentioned posted a Mac OS shortcut you can use. So download, install the shortcut, you have to enable a shortcut setting for shell scripts, but it’s just two clicks. And then when you download a UF to file now when you right click it, hover over quick actions and transfer to RPI is right there. So you don’t have to drop down to a terminal. So it makes it really almost similar enough if you’re not comfortable at the terminal that this will work out. But the biggest thing you can do is if you’re a Mac OS user, is help file a bug report with Apple. Again, read the Raspberry Pi blog post it has detailed instructions and how to submit feedback to Apple. And the more people that speak up, the faster this will probably get fixed.\nTod Kurt 1:46\nYeah, I can’t stress that enough it like apples issue tracking system is very complete. But we see none of it like all we see is that used to be a thing called radar. Now there’s this thing called feedback assistant. And it’s got a nice little like combo sort of decision tree where you just say where you’re having problems with music and you say finder and you say what you’re having. And then it’ll give you a little feedback number. But you should also in your text reference the feedbacks that have been done by the Raspberry Pi foundation and Adafruit because then they can all tie them all together and they can get into then get a sum up of like, oh, turns out a lot of people care about this one feedback issue. And it’s there’s been evidence that this works like we don’t get get to see the internals where we do with like a GitHub project. It’s been known that like, it does help if people speak up\nPaul Cutler 2:28\ndata driven decisions, the more data they have, the faster they’ll make the decision. Totally that what’s the first item that you have for us this week,\nTod Kurt 2:37\nI want to talk about matter. What’s the matter? Alright, so matter is a new protocol for doing home automation, Internet of Things type stuff. It’s an open standard that’s been happening for kind of been in process for a while for about maybe three years or so it actually is sort of an outgrowth of the ZigBee. Alliance, which was a commercial group to sort of promote ZigBee, which is a BLE like Wi Fi protocol that happened like about 20 years ago, and was a computer of Bluetooth, but really was supplanted by Bluetooth low energy, like they took a lot of the ideas of ZigBee and put them into BLE. And so that’s why we’ve now got these really great low power devices that work really easily compared to old Bluetooth, which was kind of a pain to get kind of connected up. But the cool thing about matter is that it’s IP based, so everything’s got an IP address, but it’s also mesh networking, there’s doesn’t have to be like a single router, if you’ve got a bunch of different matter devices in your house and they all can see the net. But if one of them kind of goes away for some reason, like maybe it just gets unplugged or something that won’t take down your whole home automation system. The devices can then route through one of the other matter gateways matter works with either Wi Fi or works with this new protocol called thread. Which is sort of a really low level BLE like protocol that is explicitly mesh networked and and federated and stuff but the the examples I’ve seen there are some examples you can play with right now on ESP 32 Those are the ones I’ve only seen do Wi Fi but in the coming months you’ll see more stuff that actually has these thread radios in them a lot of stuff have been shipping through radios kind of under the covers for the last year or two and so there’ll be able to enable a matter support really easily I’ll put a link in the in the show notes about like what existing things that the thread group has says like these are officially thread based things. The reason why I have noticed this as well first, the matter standards just got like ratified officially released like just a few days ago. Also there’s this cool YouTuber named that project that’s his channel name has his name is Eric, he posted on the ESP 32 subreddit that, hey look, if you just compile one of these ESP 32 examples from the matter GitHub repo and run it on your ESP dev board, iOS 16.1 just sees it as a HomeKit device and you can just start controlling it. So his example was up was a lamp, little RGB lamp And that’s pretty great that like, not only matter, not only are they talking and talking to talk of an open standard, you’ve got to GitHub with working examples on existing dev boards that are like really cheap, you just compile and run right now. And, you know, Android also has having thread and matter support. And I think that’s all turned on. But I don’t really know Android that much. So I don’t know what the details are. What I’m really excited by is this whole inherently federated, or multi admin controller that they call it in matter where there isn’t a single router, because one of the things in the home automation stuff now is you have to buy a special border gateway that will talk ZigBee or whatever on one side, and then we’ll talk to the internet on the other side. And if that goes down, then then your light switches work. Or the other problem is, I’ve got these Alexa products, and I’ve got these HomeKit products. And I either control them with one or the other. And matter will let you control them with either so you don’t you can buy a home kit daily and have it work with your Alexa products. You can buy Alexa thing and have your home get product does matter. So I’m really excited about this, even though I don’t do home automation stuff, because I don’t know, most of it’s a little overkill for for my thinking like this kind of stuff, where it’s like, open and cross company, I think is the way it should be. And so I’m glad to see it going out that way.\nPaul Cutler 6:16\nI agree. And there’s some big names. I mean, we’re talking Google and Apple and Microsoft. Yeah, it’s every one that needs to be in this is finally in Yes.\nTod Kurt 6:24\nYeah. It’s not just like random little companies. It’s big companies.\nPaul Cutler 6:28\nAnd if you’re into home assistant, which I use, I only have three or four integrations. I don’t have a smart home at all, but home assistant is both matter and thread ready right now. They’re just waiting for the devices. So if you think about how many, you know, hundreds of 1000s of installations they have.\nTod Kurt 6:42\nYeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, I’ve been really I’ve been meaning to play with home assistant because it looks really powerful. And it plugs into all the HomeKit stuff.\nPaul Cutler 6:49\nThe new Apple TV that just launched this week is launching with Mater support as well.\nTod Kurt 6:54\nOh, that’s awesome. Yeah, see? So, yeah, everything’s coming up matter. Alright, so what’s what’s your number two thing this week.\nPaul Cutler 7:01\nNumber two is 3d printing for a good cause. And I have two examples that are out there that came across my desk. The first one is 3d printing for mental health and suicide prevention. This idea was started by a teacher Abby Brown at Torrey Pines High School in San Diego. Each year, the school has a Yellow Ribbon Week where the students learn about crisis resources and risk factors for suicide. She designed the keychains to give away to our students at the end of the week is a special way to end the Yellow Ribbon Week. Each keychain contains a word such as smile, inspire, create with about 10 different words. But what’s cool is there’s a fundraising campaign that goes along with it. She posted the designs to cult 3d And if you print one in tager, on Instagram, or on Twitter, she and a number of other organizations including Joel telling, printed solid alien 3d and more will donate $2 up to over $4,000 for the campaign. So you can get a cool inspiring keychain and, you know, help money for a great cause.\nTod Kurt 8:02\nThat’s awesome.\nPaul Cutler 8:03\nIt is awesome. The second one is 3d printed Toys for Tots. So most people have probably heard of Toys for Tots. My family actually has volunteered the last few years. It’s a great organization. But this one was organized by a company called Ice 3d in 2018. And they work with volunteers in the 3d printing community to print toys for kids. Last year in 2021, they printed over 69,000 toys. This year, they have over 140 volunteers and have printed 27,000 toys so far. Unfortunately, Signups are closed for this here because I look to go sign up for that. But you can donate financially or sign up for next year. And the toys are pretty cool. There’s an articulated alligator there’s a train engine, there’s cars, there’s low poly dinosaurs. And similar the maker deck that I mentioned in the last episode, they have a Twitch TV channel where you can watch the 3d printers whirring away printing the Toys for Tots.\nTod Kurt 8:57\nAs wonderful as this is so great because um, friend of mine who’s got a couple of couple of kids of the like, you know, five to nine year old age, he got one of these like really cheap like $20 Monoprice printers, and then just like gave the kids the URL to Thingiverse or printables, whatever and said, Hey, find find things you want to print and they just had fun just like going like, oh, let’s print out yet alligator. Let’s print out this bracelet. And they just, they just he just would set it up and go and they would have fun watching it. They’d have fun playing with the thing when it was done. But you know, a lot of the a lot of toys of kids have a sort of a limited life cycle. Even if the toy stays together. It kind of like fades from the interest. And so he’s like, Okay, well, I guess I can print something else. You know, each one takes maybe an hour or whatever. Right? Only a couple of grams of plastic.\nPaul Cutler 9:43\nExactly. It costs, you know, pennies on the dollar compared to normal toys.\nTod Kurt 9:47\nYeah. So that’s awesome. I saw I liked seeing the idea. The ideas spread out to a larger community who don’t just because not everyone has a 3d printer.\nPaul Cutler 9:54\nExactly. But it’s cool to see that people that do actually using it for a great cause. What’s your next one?\nTod Kurt 10:01\nAll right, so have you ever taken a camcorder and pointed it at the TV that is showing the image from the camera? Weird video feedback? Yeah. Look at these like trippy algorithmic screen savers that maybe like synced to music or whatever. If you wanted to do something like this yourself, how would you do it right, you could get a camera and monitoring. Or you can get a video synthesizer. This is a thing that exists been around forever furnished ever since cameras existed, this video synthesizers have existed. So I was at synth Plex. Last weekend. It’s this sort of synthesizer convention. But there were a few non audio synthesizers there, one of which was a which really intrigued me was called Hypno, by sleepy circuits. And physically, it’s a small box with knobs, sliders, buttons, and an HDMI port. And it’s got a bunch of little jacks for like plugging cables into like you would a normal synthesizer. And so the sort of user interface of it is you look at the screen, it’s got like weird triangles, or squares, or whatever. And as you turn the knobs and, and slide the sliders, those shapes will morph and feedback and transform. Those are just two of the video oscillators you can give it, you can also give it a live camera feed, you can give it video files, and then those become the oscillators that you then tweak and feed back sort of in the box itself without having to have a camera pointed at a monitor. That in itself is pretty cool. There’s just like this appliance, you just plug a HDMI cable into and start tweaking knobs and you get crazy trippy visuals that you can then fully control. But it’s a breads, berry pie based thing, which I thought was really interesting. It’s also got Eurorack compatible jacks on it. So you can just plug in cables to your little synthesizer and then have the visuals sync to the music in ways that are there more interesting than just the standard like audio boop, boop, boop, this has been developed by this this guy since like 2018 or so there’s an active forum, there’s lots of documentation. It’s not fully open source, it doesn’t look like but it’s a Raspberry Pi. So it’s, I don’t know, it just seems seems like a nice hacker hacker level tool. There’s a bunch of examples of it on his Instagram page or on the products Instagram page, I’ll put a link to that in the show notes as well. And it’s just a lot of fun. It’s um, it seems like a pretty pro level product. Like even though it’s a Raspberry Pi, you treat it as an appliance you don’t like, you know, you don’t ever log into it with SSH or whatever you just like turn it on, plug it in and start tweaking stuff. And it’s a lot of fun.\nPaul Cutler 12:23\nSo you literally just take it, plug the HDMI source into a monitor or a TV and start and start tweaking the dials from there.\nTod Kurt 12:31\nExactly. And and if you want to have it as part of your live streaming setup, it also outputs NDI over USB, so you can treat it as a camera source in OBS or any other sort of streaming setups. So you can just have it like you know, Chroma Key in like up to the camera and it Chroma keys that and feeds it ball back and then feeds it and then you ship that back to your streaming setup. So you can get you can get totally crazy with it if you want.\nPaul Cutler 12:57\nWell, that’s great. And it’s offloading the processing power to the pi. So your computer that’s using OBS is running just fine. Let’s\nTod Kurt 13:03\naccess marks. It’s just seeing another camera source. So how about you? What’s your third thing for this week?\nPaul Cutler 13:09\nMy last one is I came across an article on Hackster. IO. And it’s called the IO rodeo launches the open colorimeter a circuit Python analysis tool for citizen science. It’s a mouthful, but what grabbed my attention was circuit Python being a member of the circuit Python community. And I actually read through that article and didn’t understand most of the science behind it. It’s been way too many years since I was in school. But here’s how I O rodeo describes it, it’s the open colorimeter is an instrument with many applications, including measuring contaminants and pollutants in soil and water. So that sounds pretty cool. It’s actually an Adafruit pi badge with a 3d printed case. And I think it’s pronounced a cuvette, where you add the soil or the liquid that you’re measuring. But the other thing that’s cool is this is all open. It’s published under an open license for the firmwares under MIT, in the physical designs under a Creative Commons 4.0 License. And they have excellent documentation with product guides and project tutorials. The first that I came across for tutorials were to use the color ammeter to measure the blue dye in sports drinks. And like what a great experiment. So you read through that. And again, I couldn’t keep up with all of the science, but it walks you through exactly how to use the color emulator to do that. And their mission is to increase accessibility to scientific data collection tools by creating low cost open hardware instrumentation. Everything’s open on their GitHub repository, which is pretty cool. But really what caught my eye was that circuit Python, I expect to see micro Python and commercial applications. I’m always surprised and delighted when I find out that there’s circuit Python ones out there too.\nTod Kurt 14:45\nTotally. Yeah, I actually actually ran into the IRS to people about 10 years ago. They’ve been around for a long time doing doing this sort of always open, low cost scientific tools for kind of for education, but they’ve figured out ways to take You know, Arduino class hardware and make it actually produce usable scientific results. So it’s like, oh, here’s the thing you can teach in your high school class, to your chemistry students, but you’re actually getting real data out that’s, you know, comparative to other stuff. I love it. It’s all using like, just the boards we have kind of sitting around on our desk. Like their, their cleverness is like the way that they’ve got the system set up to observe the substances being color rumored to rise,\nPaul Cutler 15:28\nright? I didn’t know they had been around for a decade. That’s great, especially for having an open company like that. Yeah, with that kind of longevity. That’s great to see. Yeah, they’re awesome. And what’s your last one for us this episode?\nTod Kurt 15:41\nAlright, so this is kind of nerdy. I mean, this whole podcast is kind of nerdy. A goal. Alright, so there’s this tool called FFmpeg that I’ve used forever. It’s a command line tool. And at the least, the least of what it can do is convert video file formats. So you’ve got an AVI and in some with some weird codec, and you want to convert it to an mp4 that’ll play on your phone, you can just do f of MPEG dash I’ve weird file dot Avi, output to phone dot mp4, and it’ll figure it all out for you. But it does so much more. It’s the back end for a lot of GUI applications. Like if you ever use handbrake, or VLC, or in player. It’s also used by a lot of websites that do video like I know.\nPaul Cutler 16:29\nDid you just say M player? Yeah. Wow. I’m having flashbacks. Many, many years ago. That’s impressive. I’m sorry, I interrupted. Keep going.\nTod Kurt 16:39\nNo, no, no, yeah. No, it’s a thing I used to use in player all the time. It was like the best video player on the maxvill for was. But yeah, I mean, it’s in player, a cross platform video player, like, how do you do that? You know, but like some of the things that some of the ways that I use it is I use it to down convert HDR video to SDR for like for all the for a while chrome didn’t support HDR content. So it look all weird and blown out. And so you had to down converted to like non HDR. HDR is high dynamic range where they kind of fake the exposure to make it look like it’s better. Anyway, I also use it to quickly crop video. If I you know, we shoot with a wide lens and you like, oh, actually, the thing I care about is in the middle, like you know half of the video, you can just use it to, to crop the image, but keep it at 720 p, I use it to decompress for K down to 1080 P because I don’t want to spend the time to upload a 4k video to YouTube or whatever. I also use it to convert audio from any audio format, be it in a audio file or video file to a WAV file, which you can then use it with circuitpython I’ll link a page of a bunch of cool ffmpeg commands in the show notes. Because it’s a great swiss army knife for doing any kind of AV thing. But if you do anything more complicated than just a simple file and file out the syntax for the command lines, arguments diff of impact is crazy. So this person, Zach, his Twitter handle is Zach overflow, he created this thing called FFmpeg dot guide. It’s a website that lets you visually create a flow of video and audio that will that FFmpeg will act upon. And so the output is a crazy long FFmpeg Command Line command, you can just copy and paste. And the end, what you see is a bunch of little nodes and flows between nodes. And then you type in parameters between between the nodes and stuff like that. So it’s so if you think in a flows a node sort of way, it’s like Oh, fine, I can use that sort of thinking to design how I want my FFmpeg command to be. And so I’m just now trying to play with it. You know, it’s also complicated because it’s recreating what FFmpeg can do. And so he’s going to have a paid version, if you want to do really complicated nodes and flows. But if you’re just doing up to five nodes, which is quite a lot of functionality, I was just totally free. And so you gotta FFmpeg dot guide website and just try to use it also download FFmpeg anyway, it’s totally awesome. Yeah, I\nPaul Cutler 19:07\nwas playing around with it. It is a great no code solution. I don’t know any of the command line arguments to pass to FFmpeg. And I was able to in just a couple of minutes figure out okay, if I drag this here and put this there, then it gives it does it for me. It tells me exactly what I need to do.\nTod Kurt 19:23\nYeah, yeah, I’m wondering how much it will replace my, my FFmpeg dot tips dot txt that I’ve had in my home directory for like 10 years. Because I can never remember how to do things.\nPaul Cutler 19:35\nRight. So what else have you been working on in the last couple of weeks?\nTod Kurt 19:40\nI’ve been building more synthesizer bits if the the trip to the simplex convention last week was very fun, and also put me more in the mind of doing synthesizer thing. And so I’m doing that and then in a couple of days, there’s Hackaday super con, which I’m going to because it’s in Pasadena, it’s like two miles away from my house. I’m kind of required to go almost.\nPaul Cutler 20:02\nYes, you are. And we expect to report back. Yeah, it’ll,\nTod Kurt 20:06\nit’s, you know, it’s been really hard to go to like big public gatherings because I’ve not been like Cineplex was the first one I’ve been to and like three years. And so I miss all these people that I that I really liked to see on in real life that don’t really see it in real life at Supercon. So really nice, but it’s also like, oh, I don’t know, bunch of people.\nPaul Cutler 20:27\nI’m right there with the I’m on the fence about going to PyCon next year for that exact reason I want to go but large crowds, and you got to weigh those pros and cons.\nTod Kurt 20:37\nThankfully, it’s like there’s a lot of big rooms and there’s a bunch of outdoor newness to the whole setup. And so I think it’ll be good, but yeah, how about you anything? Anything you’ve been up to this week,\nPaul Cutler 20:49\nreleased a new episode of the circuit Python show one that I’m particularly proud of speaking of circuit Python in the wild, I drove two hours east of the twin cities here in Minnesota dual Claire, Wisconsin and visited with Jason P core, who was part of a team who built three circuit Python powered trolls for kids to play on in a park. Great episode, check out circuit Python show.com. Check out the shownotes there’s links to pictures. The YouTube version of the show has like the Ken Burns effect with the pictures. But it was a beautiful fall day that we were there and it’s a really neat installation.\nTod Kurt 21:24\nYeah, I saw some of the photos that you shared and those those really look cool. They’re much bigger than when you said oh, they’re trolls. I was thinking like, you know, but no, they’re they’re pretty large\nPaul Cutler 21:34\nfive foot tall trolls.

(Tod #1) 00:15 What made Arduino possible in early 2000s: Atmel ATmega168P for $4 and avr-gcc open source compiler For $4 you got so much! 16 kB flash! 2 kB RAM! RISC architecture! Minimal required external parts! Now, WCH, the makers of the CH340 USB-to-serial chip that you’ve maybe seen on some dev boards, has a new chip Fellow hacker Akiba on Twitter alerted me to this, quoting a tweet from Patrick Yang at WCH New WCH CH32V003 RISC-V chip Arduino-class, only $0.10 (48MHz, 2kB RAM, 16KB flash, 18 IO, 8 ADC) RISC-V is an open-source CPU core that’s scalable from desktop-class chips to cheap embedded processors Similar to ARM cores in our iPhones and Raspberry Pi Picos But no license fee needs to be paid! Potential problems tho: bigger brother CH32V307 needs custom OpenOCD programmer RISCV-OpenOCD-WCH and only IDE supported is their MounRiver akiba’s tweet that alerted me CH32V307: slightly better version w/ USB Micropython for CH32V3 Rust for CH32V3 Jetbrains Fleet (Paul #1) 4:28 Jetbrains, the makers of code editors and IDEs powered by IntelliJ, have released a new code editor called Fleet\nFocus on Speed - “fast and lightweight” is how they describe it Code editor and / OR IDE Smart Mode enables IDE features, including code completion, quick fixes and more Collaboration Built-in collaboration tools - 1 button click to start a session and it auto copies the share link for you Distributed You can connect using SSH for example, and it creates an instance of Fleet on the remote computer you connect to Or easily connect to a Docker container of Jetbrains’ Space service I’ve been using it and I like it\nIt does feel snappy, not sure if it’s in my head or not As a hobbyist programmer, I probably only use a small percentage of the features found in an IDE, which is one reason why I like this I used PyCharrm for 4 or 5 years until switching to VS Code for a year, and then switched back to PyCharm earlier this year. Let’s call this what it is: This is Jetbrains answer to VS Code.\nWhere VS Code has a number icons on the side, Fleet has a few along the top And good for Jetbrains! Competition is good, it will drive innovation. If you’re an Atom user looking for a new editor or like to try new things, give it a try, I like using it. GitHub sunsets Atom\nPerson Sensor by Useful Sensors (Tod #2) 9:35 Useful Sensors is a new company by Pete Warden, who helped develop Google’s open source TensorFlow machine learning platform Pete is a founder of the “TinyML” movement: putting machine learning on devices you control, instead of in some cloud service The Person Sensor detects faces, basic facial recognition, can determine “looking at”, for $10! Can remember up to 8 people. But just gives them an ID 0-7, nothing is known about them, just “different” You get x,y position of face, with confidence percentage, and “is facing” flag! Uses I2C via Qwiic/StemmaQT I2C connector, so easy! API is simple, example code in Arduino, RP2040 C, Python The demo Pete published on Hackster.io uses an Adafruit Trinkey running CircuitPython to lock his computer when looks away I’m getting a couple of these boards to try out, should be here in a few days Hackster.io project article w/ Trinkey \u0026 CircuitPython EETimes article about Useful Sensors \u0026 Pete Warden Available now at SparkFun Developer Guide CircuitPython example GitHubCopilotInvestigation.com (Paul #2) 13:38 GitHub Copilot potential lawsuit GitHub Copilot - Your AI pair programmer Matthew Butterick, a writer, designer, programmer and lawyer has started an investigation into a potential lawsuit regarding GitHub Copilot Joseph Saveri Law Firm Shares examples of problems in both the training of model and Copilot usage Mr. Butterick states that the objection isn’t AI assisted coding, it’s how Microsoft went about it. Participation could have been voluntary or even paid Microsoft claims it’s fair use Is attribution needed? Bradley Kuhn of the Software Freedom Conservancy asked Github in June of 2021 for legal references to back up the fair use argument. Microsoft hasn’t provided any and Mr. Butterick says that’s because there is no legal authority for Microsoft’s position. Copilot users have shown that Copilot can offer a suggestion of code verbatim from another project Stefan Karpinski exammple tweet Chris Green example tweet When we look at Copilot usage, what could the impact on open source communities be? Mr. Butterick argues that Microsoft is creating a new walled garden that might “inhibit developers from discovering traditional open source communities.” Developers may not need to interact with an open source community in the future when the code they want is just presented to them Bug and issue trackers, source repositories, mailing lists, etc. Jamie Zawinski, aka jwz, a co-founder of Netscape and Mozilla Blog post CircuitPython’s ulab (Tod #3) 19:18 ulab: Numpy for CircuitPython In Python, any time you do a for-loop to do math a list of data, you’re probably doing it wrong For some operations, the Python built-ins “map()”, “filter()”, and “reduce()” can do the work for you But for really mathy stuff, you need something else. Enter NumPy If you’re experienced with Python, you’ve probably played with NumPy Edit images, audio, machine learning, all use NumPy It’s a wrapper around efficient native C code In general think of Python more like Lego: you connect pre-built pieces to solve your problem you can try to build everytihng from 1x1s but it’s a bad idea CircuitPython can’t have the full power of NumPy (which does linear equation solving, curve-fit analysis, etc) But it does have “ulab”! ulab does some of the most important array and matrix operations at near-C speeds For example: LED animations. a common task is “fade all LEDs a bit” Cylon effect: Turn LED on, Fade all LEDs toward black, go to next LED, repeat Firework effect: Turn random LED on, fade all LEDs towards black, repeat Fakey fire effect: [[ demo this on video ]] Normally this “fadeToBlack()” would be a for-loop In normal CircuitPython, this loop on 256 LEDs takes over 40 millisecs! The same operation with ulab takes around 4 milliseconds: 10 times faster!

I’m Tod Kurt.\nPaul Cutler 0:05 And I’m Paul Cutler. Tod and I each have three things to share with you. And we’ll spend a five minutes but no more on each one. Todd, why don’t you get us started?\nTod Kurt 0:13 Sure. This week, I’d like to start out with talking about the 10 cent, you know, point one dollars, Arduino chip. This based on RISC five, a little bit of backstory here. One of the things that made the Arduino platform really useful and popular back in the early 2000s, were two things one, well, three things up count the huge community and effort. But the hardware specific things is the fact that was based off the Atmel 80 Mega 168, which was only $4. And it contained all these features that contain the 16 kilobytes of flash 2k of RAM, it was a RISC architecture, it had a bunch of useful peripherals like serial ports and and I squared C ports. And then separately, there was an open source compiler called AVR GCC that you could use to code it. And on top of that was built hardware, you know, it kind of took the world by storm because the closest competitor at the time was the $50 basic stamp. And so if you wanted an easy to use microcontroller platform, it really became obvious that Arduino is the solution. And so And thus, you know, now 20 years later, almost everything has kind of an Arduino, version or mode or whatever. And so recently, the company WC H is the maker of this CH 340. USB to serial chip that you might have seen on some of these dev boards that are out there, they’ve been getting into making CPUs, and they just announced that there is a 10 cent chip that is based on the risk five architecture. It’s basically an Arduino class processor, it’s got 2k Ram, 16 kilobytes of flash 16 kilobytes of flash 18 io eight analog inputs, it’s called the ch 32 v 003. I first heard about this from our fellow hacker Akiba on Twitter, who was quote tweeting a guy named Patrick Yang, who works at WC H. And the really one of the other nasty things about this is it this is a, it’s based on risk five, which is an open source architecture for chips. So before like if like all of our chips nowadays that we use, like from the chips on our on our cell phones, to the chips in our Raspberry Pi Pecos, are all based on ARM cores. And it’s a really good popular core that can scale from really big powerful things like you know, tablets and phones down to like little embedded processors. But for every chip, you have to pay a license fee to arm like the chip company pays us if you don’t when you buy the chip. But the cool thing about risk five is it’s open source. So you just get the core and you kind of configure it for the scale of project you want. And then you embed it in your custom silicon and you add the other parts of it you want like the memory or the peripherals and stuff which could also be open source, perhaps, and then you make a new chip. And that’s what they’ve done. So this isn’t sort of an open source design Chip, I think they’ve not actually released the design, because the particular licensing of RISC five doesn’t require that. But it does mean that the chips themselves can be a lot cheaper, because there’s not this, this license fee that is on top of it. And so I’m really excited, this just came out. And so they’re only available on like, you know, in sample quantities from LSCs, the sort of DigiKey in China. So it should be it should be pretty interesting to see how that goes for. There’s a bigger Big Brother of this chip called the ch 32 v 307, that has built in USB, and there’s a micro Python port for that there’s rust bindings for it, there might be an Arduino version coming for it as well. And so I think this will be a really cool set of chips to observe over the next coming years. Because it could be like the next big thing it was like it could drive down the cost of little projects even more.\nPaul Cutler 3:27 Yeah, there’s no question about it, or mean RISC five, I believe, is under the Linux Foundation umbrella. And they’re a great steward of open source projects, whether it’s hardware or software. And it’s fun to watch that open source ethos start to infiltrate hardware.\nTod Kurt 3:41 Yeah, it’s kind of crazy. Because because a lot of these when you’re designing these chips, it’s actually kind of a software problem. People often write these things in this these languages called Verilog, or VHDL, which is a description language for how you connect the hardware bits together. Um, so you don’t draw schematics for the insides of a chip, you can, but you often are laying them out either sort of with Illustrator to like lay off the actual geometry of the of the transistors, or using this coding language. It’s very strange because it mirrors real life where everything happens at once. It’s not like a normal coding language and things kind of happen in a line. So yeah, I’m really curious to see how this goes forward. I’m hoping to get some samples soon. But I think it might be a couple a couple of weeks to a month before I get any value.\nPaul Cutler 4:21 Gotta take the slow boat over. So that’s right.\nTod Kurt 4:26 So what do you got for us this week?\nPaul Cutler 4:27 Well, let me ask you this. Which code editor do you use?\nTod Kurt 4:33 Well, it depends for most of my coding in C and Arduino, things like that. I use Emacs I’ve been using emacs since I’ve been since I was a little tight but for no Jas programming, which I do a lot of I use VS code or atom. I haven’t quite made the full transition yet to VS code for editing Linux config files. I use vi because I want to I want to be exactly certain exactly what characters have been changed. And so yeah, it’s kind of all over the map. It kind of depends how about yourself.\nPaul Cutler 4:59 I just Switch to JetBrains fleet, which just came out last week. And I know that you know, as you mentioned, your code editor is a very personal choice. And I’m shocked to hear that you use VI and emacs but good for you. But I’ve been using PI charm, I use PI charm for about three, four years, switched to VS code for a year and then switch back to pi charm earlier this year. And then when JetBrains, who makes pi charm as well as a number of different integrated development environments, IDEs, they have one an IDE for every programming language out there. But they came out with fleet last week, and it’s in public preview. And it’s free to use right now while it’s in preview. And it looks like there’ll be a free version and a paid version with a slightly different feature set, which is similar to what they do with PI charm. But this one has a focus on speed. Fast and lightweight is how they describe it. So when you first open it up, it’s a code editor. But there’s a button in the upper right hand corner called Smart mode that enables IDE features including code completion, quick fixes, and, and more stuff like that. So if you want it really light and fast, don’t click the smart button. If you do want to get some of that code completion, those IDE like features, hit it. Now the other thing that’s really neat is it has a collaboration mode, you just hit one button to start a session, it copies the URL, you send that to your friend or your co worker, they click it, it opens fleet, and it opens the project that you’re working on. I tried it on my Windows box in my MacOS box just to see how that collaboration worked. And it was really one click easy. And all of a sudden, I’m looking at my code from a different computer. So if you’re doing remote coding or pair programming, it’s really really cool. One of the other things that can do similar to VS code is it can be distributed. So you can connect via SSH to another box where it will install a version of fleets. And you can actually use remote computing power to run your your ID remotely. Or you can connect to Docker or JetBrains space service service. I’ve been using it I like it, it feels snappy, I don’t know if it’s just in my head, but it does feel quick. And as I’m a hobbyist programmer, you know, I probably only use a small percentage of an IDS features, I’m not using the profiler, and that kind of stuff, which is one reason why I like fleet is I’ve got a pared down feature set. But it’s still more than just a code editor Mike give me. Now I’m going to call this what this is. And I don’t know if JetBrains will appreciate this or not. But JetBrains is competing with VS code. It looks like VS code, where VS code has icons on the left hand bar, this has a couple on the top instead, the look and feel was very reminiscent of it. And I think that’s great. I think, you know, competition is good. It’s going to drive innovation. And the other thing is, if you’re looking for a new editor, GitHub announced back in June that they were sunsetting Adam and come December that will reach end of life. Here’s another option for your for someone to try if they’re currently anatomies around want something that’s still light and fast and maybe don’t want to move to VS code for whatever reason. Yeah,\nTod Kurt 8:06 there’s the whole like similarity of editors or the reviews IDE style editors, for me started way back in in with with Sublime Text, which I don’t even know how long that is old, like 15 years ago, but it had a very similar things sort of a three pane where like, the right side is sort of a top down like 10,000 foot view of your of your file. And the left is like sort of your file hierarchy. And the middle is your code window, and it doesn’t run a bunch of really good, hinting of like coloring and block completion, if you’re using a language that has curly braces and stuff, and like Adam totally stole so much of that and VS code, still so much of what but both Adam and sublime are doing and so it seems like you know, it’s like, Oh, if it works, let’s just use it. And for me, that’s great. The problem I always have with a lot of these big editors like all these is I came from a world where you are typing around in the terminal and you cd into a directory. And oh, there’s a file. So you just type your editor space name of file, and you edit the file real quick, and then you get out. And, and that’s just not the way you use these big programs where like, if you just want to just open up one file and edit it and close it again, that’s just not how it works. You know, they take like, you know, 10s of seconds to start up. And they’re meant to kind of just be this persistent thing kind of lives on your computer.\nPaul Cutler 9:15 Right there. They’re really focused on those big projects, just like you said, not that one file. And this is trying to find that middle ground, I think,\nTod Kurt 9:22 yeah, just just the fact that it’s got this the sort of two modes of the Quick mode. And the smart mode is very interesting. I’d like to see how that turns out after a\nPaul Cutler 9:30 while. What do you have for us next?\nTod Kurt 9:32 All right. So all my things are pretty much all very much low, small hardware things. So in continuing on small hardware, there’s a thing called person sensor by useful sensors. Useful sensors is a small companies created by Pete Warden, who is one of the developers of TensorFlow, Google’s open source machine learning platform. I mean, it’s also a big believer in the tiny ml movement, which is moving a lot of the machine learning stuff down to the devices to be as close to you on hardware that you control rather than some mysterious cloud system somewhere that you have no real input into one of useful sensors. First piece of hardware is this little tiny board that’s about as big as a Stamp called the person sensor. And it detects faces. It does basic facial recognition, it can determine if you’re looking at it, and it’s $10. And you can buy it right now from SparkFun. You talk to it via ice word. See, it’s got a really easy API, it can remember up to eight people the two people don’t have any identification associated with them it just it just like numbers the Pete the person’s zero through seven mean you have when you put it into sort of a config mode, it starts to remember different people and then later with person number three comes back up you can go Oh, person three has arrived and they’re looking at the device. It’s got stomach you t quick connectors on it. Pete Warden’s example, that he has a has an article on Hackster IO with a video, he’s actually using an Adafruit Twinkie, with a with a tiny quick cable going to the person sensor. And it’s this whole thing, it’s like, you know, the size of a stamp. And what he does is he uses it to look at him while he’s at his computer. And if he looks away from his computer for long enough, it auto locks the screen. That’s awesome. So and it’s got little LED on it. So it’ll tell you, Oh, I’ve detected a person. And so you can quickly see as I was little LED on, and it’s recognizing me. And then as soon as you look away, if you’ve got like your phone recording it, because you can’t look back at it. If you get your phone recording, you can see that the LED goes out, and then the screen locks. It’s just amazing that like this, we’re doing facial recognition on a little $10 $10 board, which means that the meat, which means the parts cost is probably on the order of like $3, maybe even less, and yeah, you can buy them now. And so so I’ve got a couple of showing up I think maybe tomorrow. But I can’t wait to try this out. There’s API’s in Arduino, RP, 2040, C, Python and circuit Python, like one of the other examples I saw was running off of a Raspberry Pi, where they just hooked it up to the I squared C ports on the Raspberry Pi and then use normal desktop Python to control it. And this is pretty good developer guide. But the API is so simple that you don’t really need a lot of big documentation to understand how it works. Because it’s a very small simple device, basically, just ask it, is there a person and it says yes, person three, and they’re at position x comma y, and like confidence in the in this person three is like 50%. So yeah, so I’m very excited for this. It’s pretty interesting. And it’s like, it’s hardware that you fully control. It’s not sending data up to the net somewhere?\nPaul Cutler 12:17 Well, that’s the first thing I thought of is what is the impact for becoming a surveillance society? Right, we were being monitored all the time. And now here’s a really cheap tool, what are people going to build with it? Yeah, I want to believe that people are going to build good things, but you never know. But to your point, not being cloud connected is a huge bonus.\nTod Kurt 12:36 Yeah, totally. Like one of the things that I really like about this is that because like Well, the nice things about tiny ML is that the problem space is small, because the things have to be on a handheld device. And so it can’t do a bunch of, you know, global recognition of a person, it can just kind of tell Is there a human shaped thing, looking at me, like, you know, in the case of, say, a coffee maker, where you’ve got two people who want different kinds of coffee unit, and then a person who walks up and just presses the Give me coffee button, it’ll automatically create the right coffee for you, or you can maybe, you know, look at the wall switch and say, Turn off that light. And you’ve got the cheap audio recognition thing somewhere, and it just knows that like, okay, a person is looking at that light. And so I’m going to turn off that light. And so I think there’s a lot of really cool applications that don’t, it just requires sort of the concept of a person looking at a thing, rather than knowing that it’s, you know, Paul Cutler, you know, living at this address with this phone number. Alright, so how about you what you got for number two,\nPaul Cutler 13:37 GitHub is in the news, and not necessarily for a great reason. Oh, this past August, they launched copilot, and they call it your AI pair programmer. So it’s using open AI codecs. And we just talked about open AI last episode with whisper, but they fed it all these Open Source Repositories. And now when you’re coding, it can make suggestions, not just line completion, but huge blocks of code. Well, some folks aren’t really happy with that, and I don’t think I blame them. Matthew Butterick is a writer designer and a programmer who’s been using open source for 25 years, and he’s also a lawyer. So if you go to get hub, copilot investigation.com, he lays out the case for why he thinks copilot is problematic. So he’s looking for people to talk to along with the Joseph severity law firm, because it’s a potential lawsuit. He’s not he has no one’s brought a suit yet. But I think Jamie’s a winsky aka JW Z, a co founder of Netscape and Mozilla also blogged this week that he’s looking at a possible lawsuit as well. So I don’t know if they’re together or separate. But there’s people out there that are really concerned. And what’s really neat as Mr. Butterick shares examples of the problems and it comes down to two things, one, how did Microsoft and GitHub train it? And then how is it used? So he asked some great questions he makes Some points that Microsoft probably could have done this a different way instead of sucking up all these Open Source Repositories, it could have been opt in, they could have paid some of those developers. Well, Microsoft claims its fair use. Well, if these are all open source and the majority of licenses almost every single license requires attribution, even the some of the most free and open licenses out there. And while there’s no attribution with copilot, even when it’s pasting large chunks of code, you know, you don’t necessarily know what license it originally was under. Bradley Cooper, the Software Freedom Conservancy asked GitHub in June of 2021. For legal references to backup the fair use arguments. Microsoft was never able to provide any Mr. Butter it says that’s because there is no legal authority for Microsoft’s position. And I know Bradley, I worked with him when I was at the get own foundation many years ago. And I don’t know if there’s anyone smarter when it comes to open source licenses. So if he’s concerned and asking those questions, maybe we all should be. But Mr. Butterick goes on and shares a couple of examples. He shares tweets from Stefan Karpinski and Chris Green, who wrote the original code and then shared exactly what GitHub copilot was suggesting. And it was the same code. Now when we look at copilot usage, Mr. Butterick, is asking what could the impact on open source communities be? And I think this is a great question. He argues that Microsoft is creating a new walled garden that might inhibit developers from discovering traditional open source communities, co pilot is suggesting large blocks of code, why would you ever need to go look at the source code repository, or talk to the developers on a mailing list or a forum? You know, the list goes on. So he brings up some good concerns. Now I used co pilot right up until it became a paid product. As a hobbyist, I wasn’t really ready to open my wallet, and even the circuit, Python show.com, large parts of that were written using co pilot, and I was able to refactor large parts of it very easily with just a couple button clicks. It’s cool. But it’s also kind of scary. This is something I want to keep an eye on of where it’s going. And what is that impact on open source communities.\nTod Kurt 17:13 I think this is a really a really great sort of much easier to understand example, of the problem of these AI systems like, like lizard lizard, and there’s been some talk of the Oh, where is are these Ayar generators, like dolly and stuff getting their data from, because like, Oh, this looks, this looks a lot like so and so’s artwork that has been this really popular in this community, you know, and I would know them because I’m not in this community. But anyone who’s in the community knows that clearly, this is informed by it. But it’s kind of hard because of the way it kind of meshes together all the different influences. Whereas this, it’s so easy to see that like, oh, it’s totally pulling this function from this very well known piece of code. And then it’s also copying the wrong license that was at the top of another file that has happened have a similar and so it’s just like, it’s not only is it is it just kind of stealing code and not attributing it correctly, it’s then putting the wrong license on it. It’s just like, Come on, man.\nPaul Cutler 18:07 It’s GPL license, you can’t be doing that period. Yeah,\nTod Kurt 18:11 I like how that GitHub is, or whoever it was, was touting this as a sort of improvement to the IntelliSense sort of code completion stuff. And I’ve always had a problem with that, because me being an old grizzled programmer, you know, I don’t want to just be able to like Tab, Tab tab through my function definitions and have it autocomplete everything for me, I actually want to like look at the API docs and find out what I’m putting you actually give to the function. On the one hand, I’m like app, people shouldn’t be using this stuff anyway. But the other hand, I also copy stuff from from Stack Overflow, you know, and usually I try to give attribution to that is something like thank you anonymous person.\nPaul Cutler 18:45 Almost all of my circuit Python projects or some form of a product that Adafruit did I take their code, I modify it. I don’t think I’ve written you know, code from scratch yet. But I always leave those attribution blinds at the top and make it really clear where this is coming from. Yeah,\nTod Kurt 19:03 that’s the thing is we’re always building on other people’s work, like none of us, like unless you’re getting the sand off the beach and making your own chips in a forge. It’s like everyone’s building on someone else’s work. What’s your next one, thinking of reusing reusing code. So I’m a newbie to Python. But I’ve been using circuit Python for many years. And so I want to talk about a ulab, the numpy for circuit Python. And so if you’re a Python person, if you are have done any sort of Python work, you probably have come across a numpy. It stands for like numerical Python. And it is designed for doing operations on large sets of data. In a lot of programming languages, you’ve got like a save got a list of numbers, you need to do a bunch of math on those numbers. Like say, maybe just want to add 10 to all the numbers in your big list. You could run a for loop, and you just go through each each one at 10 tenants and, and that’s one way to do it. But in Python, if you’re doing for loops like that, you’re probably doing it the wrong way because Python is not that cool. Have a language like in C, that’s the way to do it. So usually try to use some sort of a built in function. So there are built ins for in Python for things like the concepts of map, filter and reduce. And that can help you. But if you’re doing math stuff, you need math type functions. If you’ve got matrices and vectors, you want to do vector operations, you need NumPy. And NumPy, is used for like all this kind of stuff for like editing images, audio machine learning, it’s a efficient wrapper around a bunch of matrix math, this well written c is really efficient. And so you start to think when you when you use NumPy, you really start to think of Python more like Lego, where you, you find the various blocks that are perfect for building your thing. And yeah, you could try to build everything out of one by one Lego block, but it’s probably not the right way to do it, it’s going to be a lot slower and harder to deal. So circuit, Python doesn’t have NumPy, but it does have ulab. It’s basically just the array and vector math portions of NumPy doesn’t do I’ll have all the linear equation solvers and the curve fit analysis type stuff that NumPy has. And that’s perfect, because the stuff I want to do in circuit Python with a larger arrays is usually like larger arrays of LEDs of NeoPixels. And one of the common things you want to do when you’re doing NeoPixels serving doing led animations is fade all the LEDs down a bit by some percentage. And then so like if you just were to turn all the LEDs on, and then fade, fade fade, they’re just kind of slowly fade to black. Pretty much every LED animation you see will have this at some point in their code. Some examples, like the silent effect, where it kind of has an LED light go back and forth with a trail behind it. What will you do that as you just light up an LED, fade all LEDs by a little bit, go to the next led, fade all the LEDs a little bit and you just from those two steps, you get a natural one light moving with the trail behind it. Another is like a like a firework effect where it’s like shot in the face kind of go, all you do is pick a random led, fade out, pick your enemy, the fade them all out. And so that’s what this is. Of course, if you’re listening to this, you can’t see us, this is a fire effect. And it’s a pretty reasonable fire effects. It’s just a matrix of LEDs, random one turning orange and then fading down to black, and looks pretty good as diffusers, it actually is kind of a reasonable cheapy fire effects in like eight lines of circuit Python, the reason why this can actually work is because I’m using ulab or like circuit Python NumPy. If you were to do the for loop, on tuner, 56 LEDs doing little fade down, it would take 40 milliseconds. And that really impacts your frame rate if you want to do like really cool fast animations. But if you do have the same, same type of fade in ulab, it only takes four milliseconds, that’s 10 times faster. And so in the shownotes, I’d have links to a little write up I have on this and some links to some videos on some some like effects you can do with it. But I’m curious to see how I can expand this. I want to maybe make a little little LED sort of toolkit that people can use that are based on the on you lab math. Oh, that’s great.\nPaul Cutler 22:57 And I’m not sure if it’s you lab or micro lab, but I use it on the audio reactive projects. So it takes Oh, right on, it takes the microphone inputs, converts that to a matrix. And then, you know converts that to the LEDs. Oh yeah, the FFT equation is that the word I’m looking for? Algorithm algorithm. There’s an FFT algorithm that Jeff Eppler at Adafruit wrote. So if you’re ever looking for audio reactive projects on the Adafruit Learn site, almost all of them use microlab. And use that same FFT T calculation.\nTod Kurt 23:32 Yeah, that’s, that’s like one of the best, the best things they kept when they when they were stripping out all the stuff that makes NumPy very huge. One of the best things they kept was the fast FFT algorithm that’s in there. So you can do stuff like oh, I want to show the frequency components of audio. And that’s easy to do when you’ve got this little NumPy thing that just says, take this sample of audio and turn it into an FFT.\nPaul Cutler 23:55 My last one is a fun one is called maker duck. And I would encourage everyone to go to twitch.tv/maker Duck, and what you’ll see is anywhere from seven to nine 3d printers going at the same time, this is a Twitch live stream, and technically can be anything maker related, such as crocheting or painting, but I’ve only seen 3d printers on it. This is a wonderful community. Now I like watching it because I find 3d printers soothing, I find them almost mesmerizing. I’ll turn it on an extra TV or put it on my extra monitor at times. They have requirements. If you go to that Twitch page, you’ll see what you need to do to join. But one of the things you’d have to do is add your name and then the name of the thing you’re printing. So it’s sometimes fun to see what other designs people are printing for inspiration as well. But the community is headed up by a gentleman by the name of Chris Pirillo, and I link to his Twitch account as well. He goes live every night, I think, around 6pm Pacific. He’s a huge Star Wars fan so he’s always printing something Star Wars related. There. This week it was the pumpkin TIE Fighter imagine a Star Wars TIE fighter but the middle isn’t is made out of a Halloween pumpkin. And he’s got a huge a whole crew that helps him out zombie hedgehog fix him, dude. Tesla’s is are their handles that they go by. There are people that are 24 hours a day managing which printers are on that stream. Everything you’d want to know about it is on the Twitch page. But it’s a they have a wonderful and very active discord community as well. This is somewhere where I’ve lurked I think I joined a few months ago, but I haven’t been an active member. But it’s so fun just to watch all the enthusiasm around 3d printing. If you have a 3d printer, it’s a community that you might want to look into. The discord has channels for everything you can think of from just chatting in the cantina. Again, Star Wars themed to models to make to showing them off or even tech support if you need help. It’s just a great community that just has a lot of fun and shares that fun with everyone. They can highly recommend it.\nTod Kurt 26:01 This is so cool. I’m looking at it right now. And it’s a bunch of different kinds of 3d printers to it’s like there’s a some random Delta, there’s a Prusa mini there’s like an Ender. There’s like some homemade thing. It’s it’s just it’s so cool to see. I mean, this person’s got two 3d printers actually going in his little window of the one of nine that’s currently visible. And yeah, and it’s so it’s so relaxing to watch the watch things slowly create exactly the 3d printer. And then this you get nine of it all at once. Yeah.\nPaul Cutler 26:27 And to your point, it’s cool to see the different printers and even to see how they’re Modded. What fans are they using and I’m getting inspiration on how to take my printer to the next level from there. Totally. Well, that’s all we’ve got this week.

I’m Paul Cutler.\nTod Kurt 0:04\nAnd I’m Tod Kurt, and this is episode two. The show works like this, Paul and I each have brought three things to share with you. We’ll spend a few minutes talking about each but no more than five. If you want to learn more, we have detailed show notes available at the bootloader dotnet. And give us a follow on Twitter at the bootloader.\nPaul Cutler 0:20\nSo I wanted to follow up from last week, Todd, you had shared the full control XYZ, and they released a new STL last week for a phone holder in the funnel. There’s pretty cool in and of itself that it lets you use it vertically or horizontally. But when you go to the STL there’s a challenge to printed at double speed. Cool. Now I’ve got an Ender three V two. And I took the challenge and it printed out parallely I’ve never printed out something out this fast on mine. And love it. Those guys are doing a great job\nTod Kurt 0:52\nover there. That’s amazing. What filament did you use? Just standard PLA?\nPaul Cutler 0:56\nYep, just standard black PLA. I think it was Eyrone. So it was pretty cheap stuff.\nTod Kurt 1:01\nOh, that’s cool. Yeah, I love I love that, that there are different ways you can use that phone holder. It’s like this weird sort of organic C shape of the phone goes in multiple different directions. It’s pretty, pretty awesome.\nPaul Cutler 1:11\nI’ll make sure to include some of those in the show notes as well. Before we get started this week, I did want to give a shout out to everyone who listened. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, you made our launch such a success. I also should mention that I was inspired by the Python bytes podcast Hosted By Brian Aachen and Michael Kennedy for the bootloader. You’ll notice that the format is slightly similar. And I also have an interview podcast like Michael Kennedy. And both of them have been so kind and gracious as I’ve launched both of these podcasts in 2022 that I just wanted to give them a shout out and thank them for all their help. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Todd, why don’t you get us started this week. All right.\nTod Kurt 1:45\nSo first thing I want to talk about is an LED color pattern language. So if you’ve followed the maker verse on Twitter, you may have seen projects by Geek Mom projects, aka Deborah Ansell, or Deborah Ansell, aka deep bond projects. And in her co led project, she often uses these pixelblaze LED controllers. And they’re pretty interesting, their ESP 32 based you so you connect to them via Wi Fi via your phone or computer or whatever, you configure LEDs. And then you can select a bunch of different patterns that are built in. And there’s a huge online library of existing patterns of different color patterns, you can just kind of click on and click run, and they show up on your LEDs. But what’s what’s really interesting is these patterns are algorithmically defined. There’s a little built in editor that runs in the browser. So on your phone or on your on your computer where you edit these patterns. So like anything you download, you can look at you can change if you don’t want to like exactly how they work. And then you can run and you do do the standard sort of edit test run. But instead of a computer language, it’s this kind of special JavaScript D colored language for just LEDs, LEDs. And it actually is the the pixelblaze. DSL domain specific language, actually is a ACMA script derived sort of mini version of a JavaScript like language. And it’s got a bunch of built in LED and math functions. So your scripts can be really small like if you wanted a simple sort of spinning rainbow animation like the spinning beach ball on Mac OS that’s like five lines because there’s like cue functions and you know get led index on kind of stuff. So that’s one cool thing the pixelblaze controllers and you can buy them on tindy or on on Ben hex Ben Hanks pinkies site. They’re the they’re great. separately. There’s the fees, really beautiful Fibonacci LED displays. It’s a circular LED display where instead of being arranged like in a grid, or in a sort of radial arrangement, they’re arranged in a Fibonacci spiral like like a seashell. They’re beautiful. They’re created by Jason Kuhn, available on tindy any bank, he makes a bunch of different sizes them. But the 40 millimeter one, the size of like a large coin is perfect for like maybe making a wearable pendant. And so the three of these people got together and created a luxe lavalier lavalier. I don’t know how to quite say that word. But it’s a wearable led pendant, usually when these Philips 50 millimeter sorry, 40 millimeter Fibonacci spirals and it’s got a pixelblaze on the back. And then it’s got a really cool magnetic clasp. That’s also a battery holder, designed by Geek Mom. And so it’s the three of them work together to like create this sort of easy to assemble kit or might be fully assembled. But it’s like the perfect kind of perfect storm of these three makers coming together and making a really cool object. And one of the reasons why even though this is kind of old, like the Fibonacci display is the bear of a couple of years pixelblaze It’s been around for like three or four years. Geek Mom has led stuff forever. The website that they’ve created just for the light Lux level Lear has one of the best intros to the pixelblaze pattern language that I’ve seen. And so you can check that out at Lux lovelier.com/patterns. We’ll have a link to that in the show notes. But it’s super awesome.\nPaul Cutler 4:47\nI love all of their projects. I don’t know any JavaScript, but it sounds like it’s that hard to pick up if it’s just a subset of the language.\nTod Kurt 4:55\nYeah, it’s like it’s like super minimal. So like all the craziness, like like a lot of these languages. As they get complicated, fast and sort of the same way that circuit Python is a smaller, simpler version of Python than normal Python. This is an even simpler version of JavaScript than you’ve ever ever seen. And so it’s really approachable. You don’t even have to really understand coding you just go Oh, I see. It’s, they’re multiplying this number by five. Well, if I multiply it by six, oh, look, the color spin faster, or something.\nPaul Cutler 5:24\nAnd you said that the battery is actually in the necklace.\nTod Kurt 5:27\nGeek Mom was getting really good at designing 3d printable structures to hold batteries and stuff and play with magnets. And it’s a thing that holds one of these 18 650 magnets, that’s like a sorry, 18 650 batteries, and then with embedded magnets on the sides, and so just kind of clips around. Battery hangs up behind your neck and in the pendants around your chest. Yeah, that’s pretty awful. Alright, so what do you got for us?\nPaul Cutler 5:50\nMy first one is a project called whisper from the open AI group open AI earlier this year released Dolly, which I think you are a big fan of dough. Yes. So Dolly, if you don’t remember is you feed a text, it generates the pictures based on the text that you give it. They’ve taken what they’ve learned in that machine learning model, the next level, and whisper is transcription and translation service. So they’ve released some blog post a formal paper and even released a Google colab with a Jupyter Notebook. So you can see the code running, but it’s a Python library, you do a pip install, and then the Git repo for whisper, and it installs it now the catches for, for some folks, they might need to install rust, and FFmpeg as well. And I think rust can be a little tricky at times, based on some of the forum posts that I saw. But I got it installed, no problems. And it’s this easy to make a transcription, you type whisper the name of the audio file that’s in your current directory. And it goes, it just works. And it outputs a text file. And a VTT file, which I use for subtitles. I originally saw this on Hackaday. It was built with Python 3.9 point nine and pytorch. One point 10.1. So they’re both, you know, fairly recent versions. I’m glad to see that pytorch has been transferred from beta to the Linux Foundation, it gives me a little more confidence to actually use pytorch. Totally. And they’ve trained it with 680,000 hours. And they created five models have that from small to very large. The smaller the model, the faster it runs. And you can pass a command line arguments to tell it which model to run. Now, when you start to think about this, if it’s really as easy as typing the command, whisper audio file name, almost anyone may be able to use it. I’ve played around with a lot of transcriptions, because of the podcast accessibility is very important. And I’ll come back to that in a sec. But I you know, the irony was this was released just days after I had finished a personal Python project using assembly AI to create transcripts for the podcast. And I had spent dozens of hours trying to do that because my pythons not very good. And then here comes this that’s like, Hey, you can do this with one command. Now there are a couple of catches, but I’ll get back to that. So when you think about it, the accessibility part is huge. If you’re deaf, you now have the ability to take an audio file and transcript it for free. Most of the services that are out there are paid services, and it doesn’t excellent job. need subtitles for your YouTube videos. And I’ll put a VTT file for you. It’s not SRT. So that’s a catch, but it’s good enough. And then the thing that most people really haven’t been talking about in a lot of the articles I read was The translation aspect, you just pass it a command line argument. And it will do automatically detect which language is being used no matter what. But then once you pass it the command line argument, it’ll take Japanese and translate it to English. There’s almost 75 different languages supported with varying degrees of support. And you’ll see it on their GitHub page. They have a nice chart that lays it out. But it’s it looks pretty neat. The license at MIT so it’s open source already created a forum for show and tell people are already building on this. It’s been out for two weeks. I was going to share that. One of the things that uh, doesn’t do is speaker diarization Or so I can’t tell the difference between you and me talking. It’s just going to transcribe all of the text from this podcast, for example. Yeah, I was going to call it I was a gotcha. Nope. One hour ago, someone actually posted that they built diarization On top of whisper. I need to check that out. Someone built a twitter bot that extracts a video, translates it and then replies with the translated video on Twitter. Yeah, someone built a command line utility to transcribe or translate audio from live streams in real time. And someone has built a tool that automatically add subtitles to DaVinci Resolve when you’re editing videos, which is incredible as well. Pretty amazing. Using write the downsides, I was gonna say no speaker tagging, but it looks like someone might be there might be third party support for that. And then the only catch that I really saw is it’s slow if you’re not on a GPU, so it’s it’s about real time if you’re not on a GPU, which a it’s free.\nTod Kurt 10:16\nYeah, that’s, that’s incredible. It’s just gonna get better too. It’s like, it’s like the whole I remember, you know, in Star Trek, one of the many things that seemed a little implausible to me. One was the universal translator. And, you know, granted, this requires a lot of trained backlog of audio, but we’re getting close to this real time translation of audio that like we just have in our pockets or something or is on our wrists. It’s just kind of incredible that we can do that. It’s something that seems not really real, like it’s a thing of sci fi, not not something that we’d actually have in our lives in our lifetimes.\nPaul Cutler 10:48\nI agree. And in fact, someone actually built a project that transcribes the audio from your speakers live as you play it, which is almost exactly that use case that you talk about. So it’s common, probably gonna come sooner rather than later. What’s your next project?\nTod Kurt 11:03\nKind of related eventually? And I’ll show you, I’ll show you why. So, so I want to talk about music generation and live coding, but in the browser, so what I mean by this, so So how do so how does one create music? So the standard way is you write it down, either with a pen and paper or the computer sequencer, it’s kind of kind of the way I do it. But there’s another way, what if you had a code window or multiple code windows, and in the code window, there was a, there was a code block, and a code block had one part of the music of the music piece you’re creating, described in some sort of algorithm, maybe there’s multiple code blocks. And each code block describes different parts of the music you’re creating, maybe they talk to each other. I mean, we have different windows that have different pieces that are sort of interacting with each other. And that seems kind of strange. It’s like I’m reading real time software. I mean, sorry, I am in real time writing software. It’s also real time software, to generate music. And so there’s been this thing for a while that’s been around called Title cycles. And it is a live coding Environment for Music basically just presents a window and you start writing functions and the functions will start playing a melody and this function will generate a beat and this functional generative baseline, say, and and they all will are synced together, perhaps so they’re all playing with each other. This underneath what what title cycles is, is it’s a Haskell, which is a functional language that’s really good at concurrency shell on top of supercollider, which is a audio programming language, it’s been around since the 90s. A bunch of artists that you might have heard of had been using supercollider over the years to make weird sounds, it used to be kind of a kind of a compiled thing where you would give it a piece of code and it would generate a sound like a dot wav file, you’d listen to it, you edit the file and you know, do the sort of edit compile test thing that you know do with neural code, but the output would be audio instead of a functioning program. But now it’s all in real time. And so you have supercollider kind of running in real time, Haskell sits on top of it, and directs it to create audio in various ways. And then that’s pretty cool. There. But it’s hard to install someone who created a thing called Sonic Pi, that’s also open source. All this is all this is open source. By the way, Sonic Pi is a sort of one click install app that lets you kind of that lets you run something kind of like title cycles on your computer. But it’s still an app that runs on, you know, in its own little window. But what if you could do this kind of stuff in a browser. And it turns out, you can there is a library called tone.js. That is a library that sits on top of the Web Audio framework that’s part of browsers now. And it’s not just playing mp3 or waves, but it’s actually doing audio synthesis. And so you can create live music generation. Here’s a little sample there’s a thing called strudel that sort of like a mini version of this title cycles. And here’s a quick little audio piece that’s just one line of code. It’s it’s smooth, it’s small, two sets of arpeggios playing against each other. And I’m going to edit\nthis just in a browser window on my laptop over here, it’s pretty amazing. So even though toned up Jas, and and similar thing and strudel have been around for a while, it was kind of new to me that like this was able to be done in real time, sort of doing title cycles type stuff in the browser. So that was very cool. But there’s more, more. If you don’t tend to making what to make music yourself, you can go to pi songs.com, a site created by Kenton Becker. And he has used tone.js to make a bunch of little mini sites that algorithmically generate music based on the numbers of pi. So you can create music that no one’s ever heard before. And he’s got he’s got a couple different styles. I just started one up here. It’s sort of like finding the random digit of pi I just chose and then starting up as playing, and this is sort of an ambient soundscape generator\nPaul Cutler 15:00\nNice thing about this being unique is that we’re not going to get a YouTube strike against us by playing\nTod Kurt 15:05\nthat. Yeah, that is exactly what I’m thinking. Is it like I could have this play for hours, no one would care. So there’s this this one, and it’s very nice. It’s very kind of milage to have in the background. While you’re writing software, there’s also a techno one. These are the same techniques. This is a different digital pie. But it will start playing techno. Let’s see if it starts up here a code to Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, if you if you really want to go to a rave, there’s also acid hit, which will generate random acid techno baselines?\nI think that was was that the 1,600,665,893 606,930? If digit of pi is where that started, I think\nPaul Cutler 16:08\namazing. You export any of this audio to import into a Das? I\nTod Kurt 16:14\ndon’t think so I’ve been I’ve been playing around with using these various audio loopback gizmos that you can hook up to like kind of capture the audio of one app, one app and send it to a file. But yeah, it’s it’s and this is all in the browser. This is just kind of freakin amazing that like this all just lives in the browser. You can do full audio synthesis and music synthesis and song synthesis using pie. I don’t even know what’s going on. It’s amazing. Alright, so anyway, so what’s yours next thing,\nPaul Cutler 16:41\nI love mechanical keyboards, I have been using a mechanical keyboard for about 20 years, probably going back to a local company that made clones of the original IBM x t like that 20 pound keyboard. I just love them. But I’ve never built the keyboard. But that might be changing. Oh, Thomas Pol, who goes by th Paul to on Twitter has a coffee page. And we’ll link to all of this. But he’s built a split keyboard. That’s RP 2040. powered. What’s magical about it is every key has an OLED screen. So they’re all customizable. Wow. Exactly. And he’s walking through the build process on his coffee page, which is, which is his blog, which is great. So he shares there’s a matrix of which key caps and key switches may or may not work, because you’ve got to insert those little OLED screens, and they have a little ribbon cable that needs to come out of them. So if this works, I would be so excited to see something like that not just on a keyboard. But more importantly, on a macro pad. That’s where I could see a lot of use for it. Yeah, one of the really neat things that he goes through on his blog is all the competitors that have tried to come out over the last five or six years. And none of them have really stuck around. Most of them like Elgato, that with their stream deck. It’s one RGB screen, but they just segment off the little, the little parts. Yep, those those keys aren’t individual screens. Yeah. So you know, some of the use cases for that are pretty cool, whether it’s different languages, or whether it’s a macro pad, and you have different shortcuts for different apps. But it’s it’s really neat that he’s walking through that whole build process with and comparing it to other keyboards out there. And comparing the key switches and the key caps and everything that you’re going to need to actually go with it. So that’s something that it’s not finished yet. He’s actively working on it. He wants to make a kid it sounds like of it. It’s definitely something I’m going to be keeping my eye on. Because once a maker can do it, you know, some of those other companies might step in, it’ll be it’ll be interesting to see if that’s something that will ever be mass produced.\nTod Kurt 18:52\nYeah, that’s I’m really interested in this. There’s a long ago, there was a keyboard created by someone in Eastern Europe. Like it was it was it was a design agency. It was called like the Optimus or something I forget the name, but it was it was it promised a display per key. And when they finally did release something, I think it wasn’t display per key. It was maybe display per key for the function keys and it costs $1,000. And it just was like they kept having to sort of roll back their promises as they found out that it was really hard. And and then the thing the other thing I’ve seen is somebody a couple people have tried making little OLED as keyboard keys, macro pads, where they just take these little cheap, tiny o LEDs that are I squared C based and sticking them on top of a tax switch. And then kind of having like letting enough there’s enough flex in that in that connection system that you could flex the OLED and push the tax switch underneath it. But the problem with that is that you’re flexing this circuit board that’s not made to be flexed. You’re pushing on a OLED piece of glass. It’s not made to be pushed on. And yes, of course everyone when they build these after like a month or two was like oh, it’s starting to flake out it’s not working. Whereas this project, it seems like he’s taking In Karis actually running the flexible circuitry cable from the OLED, instead of using the, you know, fixed PCB connectors, he’s putting the OLED underneath the plastic keycaps rather than just having them having to be glass on the top. So it seems like he’s actually thinking about the problem in a in a durable way rather than just like, oh, let’s hack it together.\nPaul Cutler 20:20\nExactly. And it’s RP 2040 powered. And I think I think you mentioned kmk at some point as well.\nTod Kurt 20:26\nSo yes, that’d be the thing to do. And\nPaul Cutler 20:29\nit’s yeah, it’s it’s amazing. I’m really excited about that. And if it ever gets to that kit stage, I’ll have to give it serious consideration. I have a feeling it won’t be cheap.\nTod Kurt 20:39\nNo doubt. Yeah. Yeah, each of those little LEDs Yeah, a couple of bucks each right, at least,\nPaul Cutler 20:44\nit adds up quick. That’s why I’m kind of hoping for a macro pad. My macro pad is one of my two favorites circuit Python powered devices, it’s probably the one that gets the most used. I actually maintain an awesome list for the Adafruit macro pad. I love it so much. So if I can get oil up on that, because then I don’t have to look at the screen all the time. Yeah, it would just be wonderful. I would I would be over the moon.\nTod Kurt 21:06\nYeah, I did get end up getting some of those key caps that have the removable plastic bit with a little piece of paper, you can stick inside. So So I think I can then label it. So you okay, this key is for launching this app. And this key is for doing that thing. Yeah. It’s like, oh, it’d be much better if I could just like tell it to update the keys themselves, because they’re all displays. Right?\nPaul Cutler 21:26\nWhat do you have for us next?\nTod Kurt 21:27\nAll right. So let’s see here to continue the audio trend and the machine learning trend. There’s this new thing created by FX twin who’s a artists techno ambient artist has been around for about 30 years or so. And David Griffis it’s called Sample brain. And so if X twin is his real name is Richard D. James, he has been creating some weird, fun, sometimes disturbing music. It’s it’s very challenging. It’s very interesting and very challenging. Listen to some of the stuff. But he’s been a supercollider user kind of since supercollider came out. And some of his albums I think have been mostly like almost exclusively supercollider, you could do things that you just wasn’t possible with synthesizers and effects in the early 2000s. But you could write a program to do it. And there’s this really good engineer named named David Griffis that he has essentially worked with to create this thing that takes a target sample. And using a collection of other wav files, tried to recreate that sample using those wav files. And it uses some machine learning techniques to do this. It mostly just sounds terrible and awesome at the same time. And so here’s a quick little little sample of it.\nPaul Cutler 22:46\nThat is definitely terrible and awesome. At the same time. This is\nTod Kurt 22:50\nthis is the chip shortage song from Adafruit.\nSo it’s trying. It’s trying hard to recreate it. And like a lot of these machine learning things. It depends on the library of information it has at its disposal. And I’ve not given it very much, which is why it’s kind of janky but with the jank Enos it’s still interesting sonically. And so you could take that take these raw sounds and then like, you know, do something further with them. It’s free to download, you just go to the website and download it will be linked in the show notes. It’s pretty weird. But it’s been a lot of it’s been a fun thing to play with here. Now down the unasked, like, can I make you know, can I throw these samples at it? And does it change what I’m getting out from the audio?\nPaul Cutler 23:34\nSo we have dolly and stable diffusion for images. And now we have this for music. Yeah. I welcome our AI overlords, right.\nTod Kurt 23:44\nAll right, what’s your final thing\nPaul Cutler 23:48\nI wanted to highlight of maker Kevin McAleer. He has an amazing YouTube channel. He’s got 40 different playlists with multiple videos in each playlist. And he’s got a focus on building robots with micro Python. The project that caught my eye recently, though, was he built what he called the PyCon to take a Nikon with the Raspberry Pi high quality camera. Oh, and what’s really cool. Yeah, what’s really cool about Kevin is he does an hour long live stream where he goes deep. And so you’re making a bit of a time commitment, but you can scrub through it. I would rather have a long video than leaving stuff out where if I tried to build it, I might get stuck or for example, but for when he’s building the video, he takes you through the camera itself. He teaches you about lenses. I picked up a couple of things that I didn’t know he talks about computer vision and why this will work and why computer vision isn’t important for this project. And he takes you through how he 3d printed and designed it and then assembled it and it is just cool to see this 3d printed high quality camera and action. I’m looking\nTod Kurt 24:57\nat the list of the videos he’s got graded and like, Oh, here’s an air quality sensor. Here’s here’s a robot. Here’s some hackable hackable glasses, it’s, there’s a lot of really cool stuff here.\nPaul Cutler 25:08\nHe’s got a series on building your own personal. Yeah, this\nTod Kurt 25:11\nis great. And, you know, props for him for doing live stream builds, I have really hard time having people watch me create stuff. And the fact that he’s able to do that, and it’s usable. It’s usable to other people. That’s wonderful.\nPaul Cutler 25:27\nEvery every Sunday, and I actually reached out to him to to have him on the circuit Python show. He’s done so much stuff with microcontrollers. He’d be a perfect guest. So definitely looks like we might be able to do that in a couple months. I’m pretty excited. Cool. So Todd, when you’re not doing the podcast, what projects have you been working on lately,\nTod Kurt 25:43\nas you might have known, I’ve done Eurorack modular synthesizer projects in the past. And one of the one of the youtubers slash bloggers that I’ve been really inspired by is this person named huggy, Whoa, he’s a Japanese, his his YouTube channel, and blog are wonderful resources if you want to build really inexpensive Eurorack modules, which is great, because your ex stuff can get pretty expensive. But one of the things he’s created, I think, a couple years ago is this. He calls the additive VCO and uses an Arduino Nano and a handful of passive parts and a single op amp to create this beautiful, like interesting sine wave summation thing. Here’s a little audio sample of it\nso it’s it’s really simple. I all of his stuff he does by hand soldering on perfboard. I decided to this this last week, I’ve decided to lay it out on a PCB and maybe get the PCBs made using all through hole components so that maybe anyone could make one of these in like an afternoon because doing stuff by hand on perfboard requires a bit of skill. He’s very good at it. I can do it. I’d much rather have a PCB it’s much easier.\nPaul Cutler 26:57\nBut I can’t do it. I want to learn so but I just can’t my soldering skills are not there.\nTod Kurt 27:04\nNo, it’s It’s a Yeah, it’s like PCB is the way to go. And this project is a really good example of how to use the mozzie audio library. It’s this audio synthesis library for Arduino that I’ve used a bunch. And the whole code for it is just like maybe like 30 or 40 lines. It’s like super simple, pretty understandable. So I think it’s a good sort of thing to explore further, like, hey, I can make this cheap little Arduino Nano based Eurorack module. That’s what I’ve been working on this week. Very cool. And what have you been up to?\nPaul Cutler 27:35\nI took the circuit Python show on the road recently and traveled two hours east to Wisconsin for a very special Halloween episode that’s going to be coming out in just a couple of weeks. Oh, that’s\nTod Kurt 27:44\nincredible. This isn’t spooky.\nPaul Cutler 27:48\nIt involves a couple of trolls. And we’ll just leave and we’re not talking internet trolls. That’s awesome. But other than that, I had Braden Lane recently on the show who’s circuit Python projects, including he’s got a macro pad called the joypad. And then he’s got some led projects called the Loomis ring in the Luma stick that I think are just super cool. It was great having him on the show. Yeah, the Luma stick is cool. Yeah. And coming up as Jim Musa read from the micro Python project. Oh, interesting. Yes, a lot of people might think that micro Python and circuit Python, you know, being a Ford might not get along and it couldn’t be farther from the truth. We had a wonderful conversation so\nTod Kurt 28:23\nthere’s no fight. I want to see a fight.\nPaul Cutler 28:26\nNo fighting. Lots of hugs. Oh. Well, that’s all we have for you this week.

I’m Tod Kurt.\nPaul Cutler 0:05\nAnd I’m Paul Cutler, and this is Episode One. The show works like this: Tod and I each have brought three things to share with you. We’ll spend a few minutes talking about each but no more than five. If you want to learn more, we have detailed show notes available at thebootloader.net. And give us a follow on Twitter at @thebootloader. Todd, why don’t you get us started?\nTod Kurt 0:23\nOkay, we all know how 3d printers normally work. You got a 3d model on your computer, you run it through a slicer program that chops it up vertically like a deli slicer. And then that creates and then it creates instructions to draw in plastic. Each of those slices. Those instructions g-code are sent to the 3d printers one file. So 3d printers more like a 2d printer that stacks a bunch of 2d printed layers on top of each other. In fact, there was a 3d printer that use printer paper, a CNC knife and glue to make 3d prints like 10 years ago or so. The benefit of this the benefit of this approach is that any 3d object can be sliced up without knowing how the object is built. The downside is you can’t have graceful curves that move in three dimensions. But a 3d printer can move in all three dimensions at once. The 3d metal the 3d printer nozzle could move up and down while moving around in a plane creating 3d structures that are impossible with traditional slicing approaches. There have been various research projects showing this but the most approachable I just came across is the Full Control design library. Go to fullcontrol.xyz to check it out. It’s a web based demonstration of an upcoming open source Python library. The 3d model has a beautiful and well cyberpunk aesthetic with purples and blues and 3d wireframes. The site currently has a collection of handpicked gender 3d designs, you pick one you modifies design parameters, you click Generate, and you get g-code directly downloaded from your browser. No slicer needed. I started playing with this and it’s really fun. I can’t wait to play with the library itself.\nPaul Cutler 1:51\nI’ve been looking at some of those overhang challenges they have and wondering if my printer could actually keep up with some of those models that they show.\nTod Kurt 1:58\nYeah, yeah, it’s nuts. I don’t I don’t even know how how. Like normally there’s all these extra g-code settings for your printer. So so I’m, I’ve been seeing a couple through my printer and it’s a single work so I’m really curious to see what the library looks like.\nPaul Cutler 2:11\nI’m gonna have to give that a try. Definitely. The first thing I wanted to share is about an open source project called tio, T I O. Martin Lund is the developer and I have a cool story about him too at the end. tio just released version 2.0 On September 11. I’ve been using CircuitPython for a year or two. And I didn’t know about to until John Park featured in late July on his show the CircuitPython Parsec. tio is a modern day replacement for the old Linux tool screen. If you go to tio’s GitHub page, Martin shares the motivation for tio: to make a simpler serial device tool for talking with serial TTY devices. With less focus on classic terminal modem features and more focus on the needs of embedded developers and hackers. It’s that last sentence that’s key. Up until July like most users I use mu to see any serial output or errors with my CircuitPython devices. Even the Adafruit advanced serial guide for Mac and Linux has you use screen, the old Linux tool. I’ve been using a Unix like operating system for too many years. And this is perfect for someone like me who was comfortable dropping down into a terminal. I can also run to in my IDE’s terminal. It’s got a lot of cool features, but it has one killer feature which is auto reconnect. If I unplug my microcontroller and plug it back in to automatically reconnect, I don’t have to look up what serial device it was, or type the command to connect. It’s just there and running. Just like my CircuitPython code is when I plug it on a board. That’s not the only cool part. The Monday after the episode aired. Martin Lund joined the Adafruit Discord after he heard about the episode, he answered some questions and asked for feedback. It’s cool to see open source collaboration like that in the open. And when 2.0 came out, Martin popped in a difference discord to let folks know the new release, couple of users shared a few bugs, especially on Windows and he fixed them right away. He didn’t have to do any of that. But what a way to go above and beyond. It’s so cool to see open source collaboration happening in real time. If you’re looking to level up your CircuitPython skills and move on from the Mu code editor checkout to Tod, what do you have for us next?\nTod Kurt 4:14\nOh, so just real quick, I super love to reconnect is great. I had been using screen a lot. I’m big terminal guy. And so So tio was right up my alley. Because of how a CircuitPython sort of functions whenever you’re doing updates, the whole reconnect thing kind of happens a lot, at least the way I use things. So yeah, big thumbs up. So speaking of serial stuff, with Python, the thing I’m gonna talk about next is called Belay B ELAY. Belay is a desktop Python library that remotely controls your CircuitPython or MicroPython device. Like if you are first coming to MicroPython CircuitPython, and you’re an expert, Python person you might be in for a rude awakening In the restrictions and limitations that these little embedded systems have, you’re used to like having gigabytes of memory, and you don’t really have that. And so if you don’t need a standalone device, if you don’t need the CircuitPython MicroPython device running by itself on a battery not connects to a computer. And really what you want is more of a smart peripheral that you can poke at from your computer. And what Belay does is it lets you kind of treat the sort of virtual serial port going from your computer to your CircuitPython device, as this little tunnel that you can send Python code to. And so you just write in normal desktop Python. And you just use a special decorator to say, hey, basically send this code to the device. And so you’re going along in your normal big python program have a little function and it goes boop, out to the CircuitPython device or MicroPython device comes back with the result. And you can control pins, you can read read inputs, you can do NeoPixels basically just do anything you can do in CircuitPython, you can have it written in your desktop Python. And and that’s, that’s really cool. If this sounds a little bit like fermata, if you’re an Arduino person fermata is this custom protocol and sketch that runs on an Arduino kind of takes over the Arduino and turns it into a is a remote sort of GPIO device for your computer. And so Belay is a little bit like that. But because Python is Python, it’s much more because you can just run arbitrary code. And that’s much more interesting than just you know, the sort of fixed protocol that fermata supports. Believe is available on pi pi and on GitHub.\nPaul Cutler 6:36\nThe developer of Belay has been working on this nonstop it just came out a month or two ago. And it’s already 0.8. Nice first had MicroPython support, and then later added CircuitPython support and he’s just keeps going at it as in, it’s great watching that come along. I’m big into music. And this next one is a little fun. For me. This is from the Department of rock stars can be developers too: Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of the band Weezer, whom you may know from such hits as Buddy Holly, Beverly Hills, and Pork and Beans was recently spotted on GitHub. It turns out, he’s an open source developer when not writing songs, he submitted a PR to another open source project. And he also has his own project on GitHub. He’s written a Python app and released it under the GPL. Here’s the description from his GitHub repository: a Python script to update a Spotify playlist every day with all the songs from any significant new albums. It shouldn’t include single only releases anything other than a month, it should be deleted. Interesting. And Mr. Cuomo goes on to share even more detail about it in the about section. This project is for me to experiment with open source collaboration. So please feel free to chime in and participate. I’ve been learning programming since 2015. But I’ve been mostly working on my own. So my GitHub collaboration skills are weak. I’d like to learn more about collaboration. So I can accomplish more as a programmer through teamwork. He goes on to say, his project will be a first low risk foray into the field of open source collaboration. If things go well here, maybe I can start to open up some of my other repositories, it could sure use some help. And I love the thought that some of my programs could be useful to others. My first goal here is to understand how different developers can work on a codebase together. So that’s pretty cool. Now, I don’t have a Spotify account to test it out. But you’ll need a Spotify client ID and secret and then you can customize the program to even exclude certain genres of music that you might not like. But if you do have a Spotify account, and know a little Python, check it out and maybe even submit a pull request.\nTod Kurt 8:44\nThat’s great. I love it when we hear of famous people that are secretly nerds.\nPaul Cutler 8:48\nExactly. I don’t mean to go all TMZ on the show, but you know, once I saw that it saw my two worlds colliding, I had to put that in the show. What do you have for us next?\nTod Kurt 8:57\nAll right, so another CircuitPython thing. Did you know that CircuitPython has camera support? Like this is something that’s pretty new, seems amazing that it can even function that like we could have like little microcontrollers with cameras? I mean, I know that’s kind of like what cell phones are but the class of processors that that are in my in the article dev boards are like way below within a cell phone. So so this hacker named Ashish he used a Raspberry Pi pico running CircuitPython on these little cheap camera boards, and some clever machine learning stuff to do. Machine learning recognition of handwritten digits with the cameras, the cameras looking at a piece of paper, you write a digit down and it says, Oh, you wrote a two and and this is just like, like, two things I think that I didn’t think would ever come a CircuitPython like machine learning and envision, like here’s one example of it’s this both and the way it works is so on the PC he has the actual training of the of the model and that of course takes, you know, a lot of memory and a lot of a lot of memory. And a lot of time. He used a, there’s a standardized data set for handwritten digits. And he ran that through a classification system called support vector machines, which is a sort of simpler kind of machine learning that was all the rage, like a decade or so ago, it basically tries to find hyperplanes that cut through the data to sort of separate out the data. So if you’ve got a multi dimensional set of data, like, like an image is basically a bunch of multi dimensional set of data. Like images for multiple handwritten digits is a big multi dimensional set of data, you can use the support vector machine math to kind of cut through the data to create these little nodules that are oh, this is what a four looks like, this is what a seven looks like. And the nice thing about it is that once you’ve trained the model, the model itself is pretty small enough that it can run on a microcontroller. And normally, I’ve seen this on like, you know, C based things never something is as a kind of easy to use as Python, and so CircuitPython. And so um, so once you trained it, he then minimize the resulting Python file. And that’s like maybe 10s of 10s or 20 of K, on the flash. And, and so now you can have vision system CircuitPython, machine learning. And she has all blog posts on how to do this, and a GitHub, it has all the code. So you can just use his train model off the bat, if you want to try that. I got a camera board just a few days ago, and I’m gonna try this out this weekend. So let’s see if it works.\nPaul Cutler 11:36\nThat’ll be a fun project. And we’ll make sure to link to all of his work in the show notes too.\nTod Kurt 11:43\nAll right, so what’s the last one?\nPaul Cutler 11:45\nWe’re gonna come back to 3d printing. So what kind of 3d printer Do you have?\nTod Kurt 11:50\nI have a couple but the one I’m used the most as a Prusa. Mark 2.5.\nPaul Cutler 11:55\nOkay, so I’m going to talk about the Bambu Labs, which started the Kickstarter earlier this summer. Now there’s a rule in the 3d printer community to never buy a printer on Kickstarter, for a number of different reasons, I’m not gonna go into here. Bambu knew that because before the Kickstarter went live, they sent out a ton of review units to YouTube posts and other influencers. They all came back glowing about it. And a couple even follow even said they’d be spending their own money to buy one it was that good. The Kickstarter launched and they raised about 10 times what they were looking for. What’s so cool about it is the next one is generational. This printer sets the bar for the next generation of printers. It has built in LIDAR for auto bed leveling, as well as some other bells and whistles. Like if you buy the step up, it’s got the built in webcam and can do time lapses, among other things. But the key selling feature here is how fast it is, it’s up to four times faster than an Ender three or a Prusa. Wow, the quality is excellent. I had a chance to help set up my best friend’s ex one carbon, carbon, and the hype is real. The OtterBox experience was wonderful. Everything was clearly marked, and we were up and printing in 15 minutes. That’s amazing. It really is. If you’re looking to buy a 3d printer and looking at CReality Ender threes, this is not the printer for you. But if you’re looking at a Prusa, not the Mini, you might want to consider the x one, a fully assembled Prusa will run you about $1,100 in the Bambu is two models at $1,000.12 $100. With the more expensive one having a slightly better build quality and some extras like the webcam that I that I mentioned. There’s a there is some risk with a new manufacturer. There is some risk with a new manufacturer, but they’ve made replacement parts for sale already and follow through on their promise to open source their slicer software. If this is what the next generation of 3d printers looks like, I’m really excited.\nTod Kurt 13:54\nThat’s pretty cool. I mean, just just the LIDAR kind of sold me I’m like, okay, yeah.\nPaul Cutler 14:02\nYeah, it’s enclosed. It’s slightly bigger than the person that Ender and 256 by 256. They’ve done a heck of a job. You know, this is a first generation printer from so we have to give them a little time to see how the build quality holds up. But so far, so good.\nTod Kurt 14:19\nTotally, I can’t wait to check it out. Like just to view some of the videos and stuff about it because that sounds really neat.
