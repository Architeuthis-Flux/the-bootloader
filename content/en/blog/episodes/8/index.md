# Show Notes

## Episode Intro

Welcome!  

## Meet the Maker: Carrie Sundra of Alpenglow Industries (Paul #1)

If you visit the About page on Alpenglow Industries’ website, Alpenglow mission statement is to  ***To Teach You About Electronics Without Gatekeeping***.  It goes on to say:

*We are passionate about representation in electronics - the field is still overwhelmingly white and male with only ~[10% of electrical engineers identifying as women](https://www.zippia.com/electrical-engineer-jobs/demographics/)~.  Having worked in the field for over 20 years, we know how much gatekeeping and hostility there can be.  We aim to provide a welcoming space where adults can learn about electronics without judgment or any previous experience.*

## The Microdot web framework (Paul #2)

The Microdot web framework was created by Miguel Grinberg, who wrote the Flask Mega Tutorial - Flask being a popular Python web framework.  Microdot’s home page describes it as *“The impossibly small web framework for Python and MicroPython”* and is inspired by Flask. What’s interesting is that it can run on both CPython as well as a microcontroller running MicroPython.
