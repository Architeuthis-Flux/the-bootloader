**What I'm working on:** I haven't worked on much this month as I've waited ten long years for the return of the video game College Football '25.  I've been spending way too much time playing my beloved Wisconsin Badgers in pursuit of a national championship.

**What I'm reading:** Following up on the Delta-V series I mentioned last newsletter: it turns out it's a trilogy, not a two book series, and now I'm waiting impatiently for the third book to be released.

**What I'm watching:** The final season of Evil on Paramount+.  The first two seasons are also on Netflix and this show is sometimes compared to The X-Files, but it's a bit wackier.  A priest, a person of science, and a psychologist investigate the occult for the Catholic church.  Like The X-Files, each episode is a mystery of the week with an overlying plot line throughout the season.

**What I'm listening to:**
* Passage du Desir by Johnny Blue Skies (aka Sturgill Simpson).  If you're a fan of alt-country, this is Sturgill Simpson at his finest.
* Exotic Themes for the Silver Screen, Volume 1 by Michael Giacchino.  I guarantee you know this compser's work from Pixar movies such as The Incredibles and Ratatouille to JJ Abrams movies and TV Shows including Super8, Alias, and Lost.
* Podcasts: [When We Were Wizards](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/traction-media) is a 14 episode podcast that just wrapped up.  It is an oral history of the rise and fall of Dungeons & Dragon's founder Gary Gygax and the company he founded, TSR Hobbies.  There were some Succession-level machincations going on behind the scenes with the founders and the executives.
