# Welcome

Welcome to the first newsletter from The Bootloader! We have some notes from the latest episode for you, some interesting links that didn't make it into the show, and updates from your two hosts.

## Show Highlights

Last week's [episode](https://thebootloader.net/blog/2024/07/01/four-topics-and-an-interview/) featured CircuitPython, starting with some new intermediate to advanced [videos from Professor John Gallaugher](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9VJ9OpT-IPSsQUWqQcNrVJqy4LhBjPX2).  For macOS (and most Linux) users, he walks through setting up PyCharm to work with CircuitPython, tio for a serial monitor, and using `circup` to install and update libraries. 

Tod shared a number of links about embedded Swift, including a [video from Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqxbsADqDI4).  Tod also shared his ongoing journey to using only open source software and migrating from Fusion to CadQuery.  CadQuery uses Python for scripting and can also output STEP files in addition to STL.

Lastly, it was back to CircuitPython and we wrapped it up with our first ever interview.  Back in Episode 7 in [The CircuitPython 9 Release Show](https://www.circuitpythonshow.com/@thebootloader/episodes/the-circuitpython-9-release-show), I made a passing reference to the new `ConnectionManager` library, but only guessed at what it did.  I made sure to fix that and reached out to the author, Justin Myers.  We had a nice chat about the need for ConnectionManager, partnering with the core developers to bring it to life, and what's next for `ConnectionManager`. 

## Leftover Links

These are interesting things we found but didn't make it into the show.

* [3D Printing With a Twist](https://hackaday.com/2024/06/30/3d-printing-with-a-twist/) by Al Williams at Hackaday.  There's no practical purpose to it, but now you can add a [twist](https://andrewsink.github.io/STL-Twister/) to any STL you want to 3D print.
* [The Filament Color Library](https://filamentcolors.xyz/library/) catalogs the real colors of just about every filament ever made (or so it feels like).
* [Swapping Vinyl For Cardboard With This ESP32 Turntable](https://hackaday.com/2024/06/30/swapping-vinyl-for-cardboard-with-this-esp32-turntable/) by Bryan Cockfield at Hackaday: If you know me, you know I love vinyl records.  I was amused to see this "working" cardboard music player using an ESP32 and an SD card.

## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** I've been taking one of the latest courses from [Talk Python to Me](https://training.talkpyhton.fm), a free one called [Build An Audio AI App Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/build-an-audio-ai-app-with-python-and-assemblyai). It's a nice refresher course on FastAPI and HTMX and uses podcast data to generate transcripts, summaries, and a chatbot using AssemblyAI.

**What I'm reading:** Critical Mass by Daniel Suarez.  The second in a two book series, this techno-space thriller takes place in the near future with the goal of humans mining asteroids.  My summary doesn't do it justice, I flew threw the first book in the series, Delta-V, and am really enjoying its sequel. 

**What I'm watching:** Dark Matter on AppleTV+.  AppleTV+ has become the home of some really good sci-fi, from Severance to Foundation to Dark Matter.

**What I'm listening to:** The Decemberists - [As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again](https://www.discogs.com/release/30972931-The-Decemberists-As-It-Ever-Was-So-It-Will-Be-Again)
