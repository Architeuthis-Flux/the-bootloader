**What I'm working on:** I've been taking one of the latest courses from [Talk Python to Me](https://training.talkpyhton.fm), a free one called [Build An Audio AI App Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/build-an-audio-ai-app-with-python-and-assemblyai). It's a nice refresher course on FastAPI and HTMX and uses podcast data to generate transcripts, summaries, and a chatbot using AssemblyAI.

**What I'm reading:** Critical Mass by Daniel Suarez.  The second in a two book series, this techno-space thriller takes place in the near future with the goal of humans mining asteroids.  My summary doesn't do it justice, I flew threw the first book in the series, Delta-V, and am really enjoying its sequel. 

**What I'm watching:** Dark Matter on AppleTV+.  AppleTV+ has become the home of some really good sci-fi, from Severance to Foundation to Dark Matter.

**What I'm listening to:** The Decemberists - [As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again](https://www.discogs.com/release/30972931-The-Decemberists-As-It-Ever-Was-So-It-Will-Be-Again)
