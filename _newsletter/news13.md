# Welcome

Welcome and thanks for listening to The Bootloader.  We're starting a new rhythm with the newsletter 
and it will arrive in your inbox about two weeks after the episode which means it's only two weeks
until the next episode.  (And maybe even a sneak peek of the next episode just for newsletter subscribers.)

## Show Highlights

We were thrilled to welcome Liz Clark as our first guest to the show.  Liz shared the new iOS app from 
Adafruit, itsaSNAP.  It supports Apple Shortcuts and acts as a bridge between Adafruit IO and and your iOS device.

**What I'm working on:** After talking about the PiCade in episode 12, I was inspired to pick up my stand up 
arcade after a two year break.  I've cut and sanded all the wood, run the router to add t-molding, and started 
drilling holes for the control panel.  Maybe in a couple more years I'll get it done!
