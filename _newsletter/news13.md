# Welcome

Welcome and thanks for listening to The Bootloader.  We're starting a new rhythm with the newsletter 
and it will arrive in your inbox about two weeks after the episode which means it's only two weeks
until the next episode.  (And maybe even a sneak peek of the next episode just for newsletter subscribers.)

## Show Highlights

We were thrilled to welcome Liz Clark as our first guest to the show.  Liz shared the new iOS app from 
Adafruit, itsaSNAP.  It supports Apple Shortcuts and acts as a bridge between Adafruit IO and and your iOS device. 
Liz also shared the Nothing to See / Hear wireless guitar fuzz pedal.  We also chatted about the new Raspberry Pi 
AI Camera, Guy Dupont's Bumpin' Sticker, Steph Piper's maker skill trees, and a new open source firmware for Bambu 
Lab X1 Carbon 3D printers.

A few things we found interesting that didn't make it into the show:

* [Supercon](https://hackaday.io/superconference/) starts November 1st and Tod will be there.  They recently released the list of [speakers for day one](https://hackaday.com/2024/09/17/2024-hackaday-superconference-speakers-round-one/). 
On a previous episode we had shared some concerns about the lack of diversity in Supercon's lineup and it's 
good to see a more diverse lineup this year for day one.
* Speaking of Hackday, I missed this back in August, but they [shared an article about Stemfie](https://hackaday.com/2024/08/13/stemfie-the-3d-printable-construction-set/), the 3D printable 
construction set.  Hackaday describes it as "a mixture between LEGO Technic and Meccano".

## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** After talking about the [PiCade in episode 12](https://www.thebootloader.net/blog/2024/09/02/from-arcade-to-synth/#816-pimoronis-picade-max-arcade-paul-1), 
I was inspired to pick up my stand up  arcade after a two year break.  I've cut and sanded all the wood, run the router to add t-molding, and started drilling holes for the control panel.  I've never done any kind of 
woodworking, so this has been quite the learning experience. I also made the decision to switch 
from a Pi to a PC.  Part of that decision was related to RetroPie, the retro gaming OS for Raspberry Pi, hasn't 
had a new release in over two years.  I've switched  to [Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org), which has an active 
community and is available on almost all platforms, including PC, Raspberry Pi, and more. Maybe in a couple more 
years I'll get it done!

I also updated [The Bootloader's website](https://www.thebootloader.net).  It now has an auto / light / dark mode 
selection and also has search.  

**What I'm watching:** Shogun and The Old Man on FX.  I'm halfway through Shogun and I can see why it won so many 
Emmy awards recently - I'm really enjoying it.  The Old Man stars Jeff Bridges as a retired CIA operative living 
in hiding and John Lithgow is the FBI director tasked with finding him.  They have a shared history and the show 
features flashbacks to their past.  It's great to see Jeff Bridges - the old man - as an action star.

### Tod

**What I'm working on:** 

A sneak peek at the next episode:

We welcome our second guest in a row to the show.  I won't spoil the surprise, but they currently have a 
campaign on Crowd Supply for a new product.
