* [Pyjokes](https://github.com/pyjokes/pyjokes): A Python library that tells you a joke.  Have it tell you a joke everytime you open a new terminal window.  Add it to your `bash.rc` or `zshrc` file.  Pip install it, and then for zsh just add the line `eval pyjokes` to your `zshrc`.
* [CircuitPython Networking guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/networking-in-circuitpython/overview): This brand new in-depth guide covers almost everything you need to know to work with wireless networks with your CircuitPython microcontrollers.
* [Portable full size arcade cabinet](https://www.leighhack.org/blog/2024/arcade_cabinet/) via [Hackaday](https://www.leighhack.org/blog/2024/arcade_cabinet/): What if you could build a standup arcade like a laptop that could be folded down and stored away easily? For Kian Ryan, challenge accepted.
* [Bartlebeats' Frequency](https://bartlebeats.bandcamp.com/album/frequency) turned ten years old last week. This Creative Commons licensed album contains the theme music for The Bootloader and The CircuitPython Show and is available for free on Bandcamp.
* The [arduino-pico Arduino core](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) now has Pico2/RP2350 support! Arduino is my preferred way of writing C/C++ for microcontroller boards, as so much code is transferable.
* Liam Ogilvie on GitHub made ["macrosynth", full synthesizer with sequencer](https://github.com/obtusecanadiangoose/macrosynth/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file),2
using an [Adafruit MacroPad RP2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040)
and my little [MacroPadSynthPlug](https://www.tindie.com/products/todbot/macropadsynthplug-turn-rp2040-into-a-synth/).
* The [sounds of the Nostromo boot sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ywWFvjE-yU) are just straight drugs for todbot.
* [Mark Komus used a Raspberry Pi 2350 and a custom build of CircuitPython](https://mastodon.social/@markkomus/113024269593686969) to double the amount of synthesizer voices in `synthio`.

## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** Tod and I hosted a [livestream on CircuitPython Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTl1KA2MPxI) this past August 16th. We took a look back at CircuitPython over the last year and shared a couple of projects. I ordered an Adafruit S3 Qualia and 3.4" display on CircuitPython Day as I couldn't pass up that discount.  I'm ported my [`circuitpython-albumart`](https://github.com/prcutler/circuitpython-albumart) project to a now third device.

**What I'm reading:** Neal Stephenson's Fall; or Dodge in Hell.  This is my second attempt at reading this almost 900 page book.  The first time his vision of the near future gave me a little anxiety, but like Anathem, it's taken me a second time to read it and I'm enjoying it.  I especially like the callbacks to his earlier books, which is tempting me to go back and re-read them.

### Tod

**What I'm working on:**  Along with many others who are much more clever, I've been investigating the [RP2350 GPIO input issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-feedback/issues/401), as I mention in Episode 12. It's a real bummer as it means I cannot use Pico2 as a drop-in-upgrade for my [Pico-based synth toys](https://www.tindie.com/stores/todbot/).

And I'm trying to figure out if I should fix the issues with the
["picotouch_drumcard"](https://github.com/todbot/picotouch_drumcard) and
make it available in my Tindie store. I'm a little demoralized at how it
turned out, but there's a good idea in there somewhere.

Also I'm working on some Hackaday conference badge add-ons (aka "SAO"),
since [Hackaday has a little contest](https://hackaday.com/2024/08/27/supercon-2024-may-the-best-badge-add-ons-win/) going on. Hopefully I'll make some fun things for people to play with!

**What I'm watching:** [Sweet Tooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zG9RuJb3QU) on Netflix.
I mostly tuned into this because it was produced by [Susan Downey and Robert Downey Jr's production company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Downey) and I thought "huh.. and they're financing a show about a deer kid after the apocalypse?"
I watched the first season back in 2021 and
we're gobbling up the second & third seasons this week. It's a sort of
post-apocalyptic story also with half-human/half-animal kids. Despite
the setup it's ultimately very hopeful.

Also, we went to this amazing art exhibition a few days ago
called ["AVOID MISSING BALL"](https://space.ayzenberg.com/) by
[Supercade](http://www.supercade.com/), aka Van Burnham, whom I finally got
to meet.  The exhibition is about
the genesis of video games from the earliest transistor-only ones like Pong.
It had several lovingly-restored games from the 1970s, many playable!
And as a bonus, since we were there on opening day,
[Al Acorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Alcorn), the inventor
of Pong and employee #3 at Atari, gave an hour long talk on the history of that time. It was incredible.
