## Intro

### Version 1
Welcome to The Bootloader, I’m host 1 and I’m here with my cohost, host 2.

Here’s the way the show works.  Each episode host 2 and I will share a few things from around the web we found interesting and why.  We’ll limit each one to a few minutes  - no more than 5 - and we’ll also be keeping detailed show notes for you if case you want to learn more.

So let’s dive in! Host 2, what do you have to kickoff the first episode?

### Version 2

Host 1: Welcome to The Bootloader, I'm host 1.

Host 2: And I'm host 2 and this is Episode 1.

Host 2: The show works like this:  Host 1 and I have each brought 3 things to share with you.  We'll spend a few minutes talking about each, but no more than five.  If you want to learn more, we have detailed show notes available at thebootloader.net and give us a follow on Twitter @thebootloader.

Host 2: Host 1, why don't you get us started.
