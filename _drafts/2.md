# TBL E2
## Show Intro

### Version 1
Welcome to The Bootloader, I’m host 1 and I’m here with my cohost, host 2.

Here’s the way the show works.  Each episode host 2 and I will share a few things from around the web we found interesting and why.  We’ll limit each one to a few minutes  - no more than 5 - and we’ll also be keeping detailed show notes for you if case you want to learn more.

So let’s dive in! Host 2, what do you have to kickoff the first episode?

### Version 2

Host 1: Welcome to The Bootloader, I'm host 1.

Host 2: And I'm host 2 and this is Episode 2.

Host 2: The show works like this:  Host 1 and I have each brought 3 things to share with you.  We'll spend a few minutes talking about each, but no more than five.  If you want to learn more, we have detailed show notes available at thebootloader.net and give us a follow on Twitter @thebootloader.

Host 2: Host 1, why don't you get us started.

### LED Color Pattern Language in Pixelblaze

* If you follow maker types on Twitter, You may've seen LED projects by [GeekMomProjects (Debra Ansell)](https://www.geekmomprojects.com)
* She often uses [Pixelblaze](https://electromage.com/pixelblaze) LED controllers

* Pixelblaze:
  * Created by [Ben Henke](https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze) and have been around for several years
  * ESP32-based, connect via WiFi, control in a browser, via your phone/computer/etc.
  * Configure your LEDs
  * Then, Select from a bunch of interesting patterns
  * [Huge online library](https://electromage.com/patterns) of user-contributed patterns
  * Most importantly: patterns are described algorithmically in a tiny scripting language
  * Built-in editor to edit/test/run your patterns

* Pixelblaze DSL scripting language
  * Runs an ECMAScript-based language (subset of Javascript, basically)
  * Lots of built-in LED- and math-related functions to make scripts small
  * E.g. simple spinning rainbow animation is 5 lines of Javascripty code

* Fibonacci LED displays
  * If you peruse the makerverse, you may also have spied these amazing Fibonacci spiral circular LED displays
  * They're beautiful, created by Jason Coon and [available on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/jasoncoon/)
  * The super tiny 40mm Fibonnaci display is perfect for a wearable

* But why is this new?  [Lux Lavelier](https://luxlavalier.com/) is why
  * Lux Lavalier is a wearable LED pendant powered by Pixelblaze with a magnetic battery clasp
  * But getting the display + Pixelblaze + battery all hooked up correctly can be a challenge
  * So Geek Mom, Jason Coon, and Ben Hencke all got together and made Lux Lavalier
  * The Lux Lavalier Patterns guide is one of the best intros to Pixelblaze I've seen: https://luxlavalier.com/patterns


### Music generation and Live coding, but in the browser w/ Tone.js

* How does one create music?
  * One way is writing it down, with either pen & paper or computer sequencer
  * This is how I make stuff, how most people do it.
  * But there's another way!
  * What if instead you had a code editor window with code that defines your music?
  * Maybe with multiple code blocks or windows all running simultaneously for different musical parts

* This is [TidalCycles](http://tidalcycles.org/), a live coding environment
  * It uses the functional langauge [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (which is really good at concurrency)
  * To control [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider), an open source audio programming language that's been around since the 90s
  * (Many artists have used SuperCollider over the years to make interesting sounds for their tracks)
  * Tidal can be a bit hard to install though
  * [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) basically an easier-to-install version of TidalCycles
  * But it's still an app
  * [maybe insert some sound demos here]

* What if we could do similar things IN THE BROWSER?
  * Tone.js is a Web Audio Framework for creating interactive music in the browser
  * Not just playing WAVs or MP3s but algorithmically creating sound
  * And people have been building on top of this
  * [Strudel](https://loophole-letters.vercel.app/strudel) is a music live coding for your browser
  * [[ DEMO IT HERE: 'stack("c4 f3 g4 a#4", "c2 g2".slow(2)).echo(4, 1/8, .5)' ]]

* But wait, instead of Music Live Coding what if you want music no one's ever heard?
  * This is what Pi Songs is: https://pisongs.com/  by Canton Becker
  * Algorithmically generated music based on the numbers of Pi
  * Here's music no one's ever heard before: (pick one)
    * https://pisongs.com/shepardspi/?position=46065396
    * https://pisongs.com/shepardspi/?position=46065402
    * https://pisongs.com/shepardspi/?position=575912300&t=1664758364
    * https://pisongs.com/shepardspi/?position=46059111&t=1665084073

* And then there's 30-second Acid Hit: https://pisongs.com/acid/
  * demo it

* And note these were all done with Tone.js in the browser. It's freaking amazing

### Samplebrain by Aphex Twin & Dave Griffiths -  https://thentrythis.org/projects/samplebrain/

* Aphex Twin (Richard D James) makes weird & interesting techno & ambient music
* He's been a SuperCollider user since it came out, some of his albums are almost exclusively SuperCollider
* He worked with Dave Griffiths to make this sample mashup tool called samplebrain
* It uses soem ML techniques to try to recreate a "target" sound file using other samples
* Mostly it makes glorious noise
* [[ DEMO audio ]]



### What I'm up to this week

* Making PCBs from the amazing cheapie Eurorack designs by Hawigo
  * https://www.youtube.com/c/HAGIWO
  * Specifically, the "Additive VCO" that combines sinewaves in interesting ways
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjWOJ-h5w5w
    * Uses the Mozzi audio library and Arduino Nano!
    * [[ demo audio from youtube ]]
