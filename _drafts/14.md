## Show Notes

### Insert Title Here (Kevin #1)

Kevin's first cool thing to share.

### Manyfold (Paul #1)

[Manyfold](https://manyfold.app) is a self-hosted solution to organize and share your files for 3D
printing.  It's also connected to the Fediverse, allowing you to follow instances (aka server) or
creators.  You can run it in single-user mode or multi-user.  You can also make files public or private,
which is great for saving models you might have paid for but don't or can't share publicly.

* [Suported file formats](https://manyfold.app/manual/supported_formats.html) include 3MF, Blender,
FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, STEP, STL, OBJ, GCode, BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG, and even video files in MP4 or MPEG.
It also support Markdown, PDF, and text files.

### Insert Title Here (Kevin #2)

Kevin's second cool thing to share.

### FlexPi Kickstarter (Paul #2)

The FlexPi is a new Raspberry Pi Pico with a few tricks up its sleeve.  First - it's flexible,
hence the name.  It also includes a few upgrades from the original Raspberry Pi Pico, including
using USB-C instead of Micro-USB and a programmable Neopixel built-in.  Otherwise, the pinout stays
the same as the popular Pico.

It currently has a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/top-diy/flexico-flexible-raspberry-pi-pico)
running through November 24th.  They've already reached their funding goal, having raised about $7000.
Remember, it is a Kickstarter and backing the project doesn't always guarantee delivery.
