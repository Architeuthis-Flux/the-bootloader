## Show Notes

### Insert Title Here (Kevin #1)

Kevin's first cool thing to share.

### Manyfold (Paul #1)

[Manyfold](https://manyfold.app) is a self-hosted solution to organize and share your files for 3D
printing.  It's also connected to the Fediverse, allowing you to follow instances (aka server) or
creators.  You can run it in single-user mode or multi-user.  You can also make files public or private,
which is great for saving models you might have paid for but don't or can't share publicly.

* [Suported file formats](https://manyfold.app/manual/supported_formats.html) include 3MF, Blender,
FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, STEP, STL, OBJ, GCode, BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, SVG, and even video files in MP4 or MPEG.
It also support Markdown, PDF, and text files.

### Quake on a SparkFun Thing Plus Matter board (Tod #1)

[next-hack.com got Quake running on a Feather-sized board](https://next-hack.com/index.php/2024/09/22/quake-port-to-sparkfun-and-arduino-nano-matter-boards-using-only-276-kb-ram/)

We've all seen the "Doom ported to *insert tiny electronics here*". Those are all
good hacks. Doom's game engine isn't real 3D though, more like 2.5D:
the enemies are 2D sprites and level geometry is perturbations of a 2D plane.
But the game Quake, id software's follow-up effort, was real 3D:
fully-polygonal monsters and game world.
Real 3D can be tough, so I figured it'd be awhile before we saw a port of Quake to tiny microcontrollers.

And yet, the folks at nexxt-hack.com have Quake running on a SparkFun Thing Plus Matter board.
This board is in the Feather format (0.9" x 2") and sports a MGM240P wireless module
for doing Bluetooth and Matter wireless protocols. This module also sports a EFR32MG24 chip,
which is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M33 processor at 39 MHz, 1.5MB flash and 256 kB of RAM.
(This is essentially the same specs as the new RP2350 from RasPi, so maybe we'll see Quake on an
Adafruit Feather soon?)

After proving the idea using the SparkFun board, they designed a complete Quake-playing
gamepad with built-in screen, joysticks, sound, and battery.
This time using the Arduino Nano Matter board (which has a similar MGM240-series module on it)
You can also run their port of Doom on it. :-)  Of course, you can download the schematic,
board files, and bill-of-materials from their site if you want to build your own.

### Insert Title Here (Kevin #2)

Kevin's second cool thing to share.

### FlexPi Kickstarter (Paul #2)

The FlexPi is a new Raspberry Pi Pico with a few tricks up its sleeve.  First - it's flexible,
hence the name.  It also includes a few upgrades from the original Raspberry Pi Pico, including
using USB-C instead of Micro-USB and a programmable Neopixel built-in.  Otherwise, the pinout stays
the same as the popular Pico.

It currently has a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/top-diy/flexico-flexible-raspberry-pi-pico)
running through November 24th.  They've already reached their funding goal, having raised about $7000.
Remember, it is a Kickstarter and backing the project doesn't always guarantee delivery.

### EMMG MIDI Synth (Tod #2)

A hacker in our community, Johnathan Bisson / @bjonnh, created the
[EMMG Midi Synth](https://www.bjonnh.net/project/emmg_midi_synth_controller/) as
a teaching tool for a [Workshop on MIDI and music synthesis](https://github.com/bjonnh/2024_emmg_workshop_midi) at the
Pumping Station One hackerspace in Chicago
