### Paul Items
* [Jetbrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)
  * Jetbrains, the makers of code editors and IDEs powered by IntelliJ, have released a new code editor called Fleet.
  * Focus on Speed - “fast and lightweight” is how they describe it
  * Code editor and / OR IDE
    * Smart Mode enables IDE features, including code completion, quick fixes and more
  * Collaboration
    * Built-in collaboration tools - 1 button click to start a session and it auto copies the share link for you
  * Distributed
    * You can connect using SSH for example, and it creates an instance of Fleet on the remote computer you connect to
  * Or easily connect to a Docker container of Jetbrains’ Space service

* I’ve been using it and I like it
  * It does feel snappy, not sure if it’s in my head or not
  * As a hobbyist programmer, I probably only use a small percentage of the features found in an IDE, which is one reason why I like this
  * I used PyCharrm for 4 or 5 years until switching to VS Code for a year, and then switched back to PyCharm earlier this year.
  * Let’s call this what it is:  This is Jetbrains answer to VS Code.
  * Where VS Code has a number icons on the side, Fleet has a few along the top
  * And good for Jetbrains! Competition is good, it will drive innovation.  If you’re an Atom user looking for a new editor or like to try new things, give it a try, I like using it.
