## Show Intro

### Paul Items
* [Jetbrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)
  * Jetbrains, the makers of code editors and IDEs powered by IntelliJ, have released a new code editor called Fleet
  * Focus on Speed - “fast and lightweight” is how they describe it
  * Code editor and / OR IDE
    * Smart Mode enables IDE features, including code completion, quick fixes and more
  * Collaboration
    * Built-in collaboration tools - 1 button click to start a session and it auto copies the share link for you
  * Distributed
    * You can connect using SSH for example, and it creates an instance of Fleet on the remote computer you connect to
  * Or easily connect to a Docker container of Jetbrains’ Space service

* I’ve been using it and I like it
  * It does feel snappy, not sure if it’s in my head or not
  * As a hobbyist programmer, I probably only use a small percentage of the features found in an IDE, which is one reason why I like this
  * I used PyCharrm for 4 or 5 years until switching to VS Code for a year, and then switched back to PyCharm earlier this year.
  * Let’s call this what it is:  This is Jetbrains answer to VS Code.
  * Where VS Code has a number icons on the side, Fleet has a few along the top
  * And good for Jetbrains! Competition is good, it will drive innovation.  If you’re an Atom user looking for a new editor or like to try new things, give it a try, I like using it.

* [GitHub Copilot potential lawsuit](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/)
  * [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - Your AI pair programmer
* Matthew Butterick, a writer, designer, programmer and lawyer has started an investigation into a potential lawsuit regarding GitHub Copilot
  * [Joseph Saveri Law Firm](https://www.saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/github-copilot-intellectual-property-investigation)
  * Shares examples of problems in both the training of model and Copilot usage
  * Mr. Butterick states that the objection isn't AI assisted coding, it's how Microsoft went about it.
    * Participation could have been voluntary or even paid
    * Microsoft claims it's fair use
    * Is attribution needed?
    * [Bradley Kuhn of the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/) asked Github in June of 2021 for legal references to back up the fair use argument.  Microsoft hasn't provided any and Mr. Butterick says that's because there is no legal authority for Microsoft's position.
    * Copilot users have shown that Copilot can offer a suggestion of code verbatim from another project
    * [Stefan Karpinski exammple tweet](https://twitter.com/stefankarpinski/status/1410971061181681674)
    * [Chris Green example tweet](https://twitter.com/ChrisGr93091552/status/1539731632931803137)
  * When we look at Copilot usage, what could the impact on open source communities be?
    * Mr. Butterick argues that Microsoft is creating a new walled garden that might "inhibit developers from discovering traditional open source communities."
    * Developers may not need to interact with an open source community in the future when the code they want is just presented to them
      * Bug and issue trackers, source repositories, mailing lists, etc.
* Jamie Zawinski, aka jwz, a co-founder of Netscape and Mozilla
* [Blog post](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/10/copilot-lawsuit/)

* MakerDeck
  * MakerDeck [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/makerdeck)
    * Twitch livestreams 7-9 3D printers all printing at the same time
    * Can be anything maker related, such as crocheting or painting
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/makerdeck)
  * Chris Pirillo on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ChrisPirillo)
    * Live on Twitch everyday at 6pm PST
    * Huge Star Wars fan!
  * Crew helping including @pezliz, zombiehedgehog, and @fixumdude
    * Everything you want to know is on their Twitch page, from What is MakerDeck to how to participate and helpful hints
  * Wonderful and very active Discord community
    * Every channel you can think of from chatting in the Cantina to models to make to showing them off or even tech support if you need help
