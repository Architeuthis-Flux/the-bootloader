* [WithDiode.com](https://www.withdiode.com/explore) -- 3d breadboard simulation in the browser
  * omg. this is the best. so fun
  * Created by [Kennth Cassel](https://twitter.com/KennethCassel)
    * (who also created a nice [Vim tutorial site called vim.so](https://www.vim.so/)
  * I saw it first from [Clive Thompson (@clive@saturation.social) on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@clive@saturation.social/109344907748519044)
  * I was able to implement some of the oscillators we did during
    [Deep Fried Neurons](https://blog.crashspace.org/tag/deep-fried-neurons/)
    * [DeepFriedNeurons breadboard oscillators](https://blog.crashspace.org/2021/05/dfn-happy-hour-no-43-good-vibrations/)
  * Other tools I find useful in this space:
    * [Wokwi simulator](https://wokwi.com/) lets you simulate Arduino, Micropython, and CircuitPython
    * [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) lets you visually breadboard up circuits,
      with accompanying breadboard & PCB layout

* [RNBO](https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo) -- Turn Max patches into VST plugins
  * [good synthanatomy article](https://www.synthanatomy.com/2022/11/rnbo-turns-your-max-patches-into-hardware-vst-plugins-and-web-applications.html) about why this is cool
  * [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) is part of Ableton Live, or a stand-alone application
    * a way to create custom virtual instruments or effects, w/ custom UI
    * but had to exist inside of Max or Live
  * RNBO is $299 for permanent license or $10/month subscription
  * Turns any Max patch into a C++-based stand-alone VST
  * Can even target Raspberry Pi, so you can make custom Pi-based synths & pedals
  * Or can export to Web Audio, with Javascript control!

* [State of the Open Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4) - Nov 13, 2022
  * Annual look at the smart home ecosystem and Home Assistant
  * Focused on local control and privacy 
  * #2 open source project on Github by contributor contributions
  * Home Assistant Cloud from Nabu Casa processed 50,000 webhooks per second
  * 190,000 instances of HA opted in to reporting
    * Estimated 500,000 - 600,000 installations of HA
  * 2023: Year of Voice
    * Rhasspy voice assistant: https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy by Michael Hansen
      * Can function completely disconnected from the Internet
      * Are entirely free/open source with a permissive license (MIT)
      * Works well with freely available home automation software
      * Optimized for working with MQTT, HTTP and Websockets with Home Assistant having built in support
      * Support for over 25 different languages
    * Hired by Nabu Casa to work on and integrate Rhasspy full-time
    * [Summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQjw-j7rXI)

* GitHub in the news
  * Follow-up: the investigation has spawned a [GitHub Copilot lawsuit](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/11/githubs_copilot_opinion/):
  * [Hey Github](https://githubnext.com/projects/hey-github)
    * Imagine being able to code hands free
    * This could be big for accessibility
    * Use natural speech, for example: Saying "Import pandas" results in `import pandas as pd`
    * In the features, Github shares:
      * Write / edit code (using GitHub Copilot)
      * Go to the next method with code navigation ("Hey GitHub go to line 34 or method X)
      * Run the program and control your IDE using any VS Code command
      * Code Summarization: Ask "Hey GitHub!" to explain lines 3-10 and get a summary of what the code does
