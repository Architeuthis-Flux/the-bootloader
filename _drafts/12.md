### Pimoroni's Picade Max Arcade (Paul #1)
Paul has been talking about building a standup arcade for years.  Pimoroni just launched the [Picade Max](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade-max?variant=42007494623315), a bar top arcade you assemble yourself for Â£495 or about $650.  It works with the Raspberry Pi and includes a 4:3 19" screen with HDMI driver board.  It includes everything you need to get started, minus the Pi, such as joysticks, buttons, and speakers.  The Picade Max Control Board is the interface to the Raspberry Pi 5 and is itself powered by an rp2040 and works just like a normal gamepad / keyboard.  The sound is also powered by an rp2040, the Picad Max Audio Board, that acts as a USB soundcard with 3 watts of power and a rotary encoder on the rear to control the volume.  It's powered by the Power HAT for the Raspberry Pi.
