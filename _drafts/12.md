## Show Notes

### Liz's Pick #1: First cool project (Liz #1)
[squid.jpg's Wii Nunchuck BLE Adapter](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/squid_jpg/pages/wii-nunchuck-ble-adapter)

squid.jpg works on really fantastic projects in general, and his most recent uses an nRF52840 Feather with a Wii Nunchuck adapter over I2C to control some LED glasses. I think its a great use of the Nunchuck and I love BLE projects because you get the wireless control without the overhead of WiFi. Where we're starting to get into Halloween season I can see this being used for some spooky activities.

### Pimoroni's Picade Max Arcade (Paul #1)
Paul has been talking about building a standup arcade for years.  Pimoroni just launched the [Picade Max](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade-max?variant=42007494623315), a bar top arcade you assemble yourself for Â£495 or about $650.  It works with the Raspberry Pi and includes a 4:3 19" screen with HDMI driver board.  It includes everything you need to get started, minus the Pi, such as joysticks, buttons, and speakers.  The Picade Max Control Board is the interface to the Raspberry Pi 5 and is itself powered by an rp2040 and works just like a normal gamepad / keyboard.  The sound is also powered by an rp2040, the Picade Max Audio Board, that acts as a USB soundcard with 3 watts of power and a rotary encoder on the rear to control the volume.  It's powered by the Power HAT for the Raspberry Pi.

### Liz's Pick #2: Second cool project (Liz #2)
[HiChord Pocket Synth](https://hichord.shop/)

On instagram I came across yet another adorable mini synth. This one is called the HiChord and its creator touts it as a pocket chord synthesizer. Essentially you can press the buttons to go thru chord progressions that fit in a key of your choosing and as a music theory enthusiast I find that to be really satisfying. My favorite pocket operator is the Arcade (purple one) because it has chords that you can drone in the background that share the same key with the pocket operators (C maj/A min) so it reminds me a bit of that but expanded upon. The kickstarter just ended and it looks like it is built on a [Daisy Seed from Electrosmiith](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed), which has become really popular for smaller indie synths. I'm always looking for inspiration for unique musical interfaces and I really appreciate the layout and functionality in this device.

### Stratasys sues Bambu Lab over 3D printing patents.
Stratasys, an early pioneer in 3D printing who also acquired MakerBot in 2013, has [sued Bambu Lab](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/stratasys-sues-bambu-lab-over-patents-used-widely-by-consumer-3d-printers/). The lawsuit focuses on PEI-coated build plates, purge towers, and automatic bed leveling.  These features are common across multiple 3D printer brands, so why sue Bambu Lab?
