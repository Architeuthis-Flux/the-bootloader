### Paul Items

* 3D printing for good causes
  * [3D Printing for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Campaign](https://3dwithus.com/3d-printing-for-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention)
    * The idea was started by a teacher, Abby Brown, at Torrey Pines High School.  
    * Each year the school has Yellow Ribbon week where students are learn about crisis resources and risk factors for suicide.
    * The keychains were designed to give away to her students as a special way to end Yellow Ribbon Week.
    * Each keychain contains a word, such as "Smile", "Inspire", "Create", with about 10 different words.
    * There's a fundraising campaign where you can print one of the designs found on Cults3D and post it on Twitter and Facegram.
    * Different organizations are matching the funds, with an opportunity to raise over $4000 by just printing and sharing!
