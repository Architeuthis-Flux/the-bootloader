* 3D printing for good causes
  * [3D Printing for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Campaign](https://3dwithus.com/3d-printing-for-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention)
    * The idea was started by a teacher, Abby Brown, at Torrey Pines High School.
    * Each year the school has Yellow Ribbon week where students are learn about crisis resources and risk factors for suicide.
    * The keychains were designed to give away to her students as a special way to end Yellow Ribbon Week.
    * Each keychain contains a word, such as "Smile", "Inspire", "Create", with about 10 different words.
    * There's a fundraising campaign where you can print one of the designs found on Cults3D and post it on Twitter and Facegram.
    * Different organizations are matching the funds, with an opportunity to raise over $4000 by just printing and sharing!
  * [https://www.ic3dprinters.com/2022-toys/](3D Printed Toys for Tots campaign)
    * Organized by IC3D in 2018, they work with volunteers in the 3D printing community to print toys for kids
      * Over 69,000 toys printed in 2021!
      * This year they have over 140 volunteers and have printed 27,000 toys so far.
      * You can donate financially or sign up to help print toys
      * Toys include an articulated alligator, a train engine, cars, low poly dinosaurs, and more.
    * The signup period is now over to volunteer for printing, but keep an eye out for this next year.

* macOS Ventura cannot copy UF2 files
  * [Adafruit Blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/)
  * [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/)
  * You cannot drag and drop UF2 and HEX files using macOS Finder - it results in an error
  * Two workarounds
    * Use the terminal: `cp -X blink.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/`
    * Install a macOS short created by Alasdair Allen (author of the Rasperry Pi blog post above)
      * [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/989b90c87fec4c11965dd517685f87cd)
      * Works great!  Update Shortcuts settings to allow shell scripts and just right click a UF2 image to transfer it

* [IO Rodeo Launches the Open Colorimeter, a CircuitPython Analysis Tool for Citizen Science - Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/io-rodeo-launches-the-open-colorimeter-a-circuitpython-analysis-tool-for-citizen-science-4e0435072e21)
  * Hackster.io article from Gareth Halfacree
  * The Open Colorimeter is an instrument with many applications, including measuring contaminants & pollutants in soil & water
    * Based on the Adafruit PyBadge
  * IO Rodeo's mission is to increase accessibility to scientific data collection tools by creating low-cost, open hardware instrumentation.

* Follow-up:
  * 10 cent Arduino-class RISC-V chip from WCH now has a dev board on Tindie
  * Chip is WCH CH32V003  (2kB RAM, 16kB flash)
  * Tindie page: https://www.tindie.com/products/adz1122/ch32v003-risc-v-mcu-development-board/
  * Was $6 now $10 (due to demand probably)
  * [More info on Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/wch-launches-a-sub-10-risc-v-microcontroller-while-a-6-90-dev-board-gets-you-started-90b1ffd7490a)

* Matter officially supported in iOS 16.1
  * Matter is an open standard for smart home IoT stuff (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc all signed on)

* Hypno "video synthesizer" from Sleepy Circuits
  * Have you ever taken a camcorder and point it at the TV to get weird video feedback?
  * Have you ever enjoyed those trippy algorithmic screen savers?
  * You can do both in real-time with devices called "video synthesizers"
  * Small box with knobs, sliders, and buttons to create generative video patterns
  * Source can be video "oscillators", camera feeds, video files
  * Raspberry Pi 3 or 4-based, with Eurorack-compatible jacks to sync to your music

* ffmpege.guide makes configuring FFMPEG easy
  * https://ffmpeg.guide
  * [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) is tool used behind-the-scenes by many video processors including MPlayer, Handbrake, VLC
  * And used by many websites that handle A/V
  * At it's simplist, it converts video formats (AVI to MP4) but it can do so much more
  * I use it to:
      * Down-convert HDR video to SDR, resample to 720p (for players that don't support HDR)
      * Quickly cropping videos in a bit when shooting with a wide-angle lens
      * Recompress 4K video to 1080p with reduced bitrate usable by Twitter/Youtube
      * Convert audio of any format to .WAV
  * [Example FFMEG commands](https://catswhocode.com/ffmpeg-commands/)
  * FFMPEG can do much more and it's famously complicated to use
  * It's been around for over 20 years!  wow!
  * "ffmpeg.guide" is a "Flows & nodes"-based GUI for generating FFMPEG commandline commands
  * Free for up to 5 nodes
  * [Developer post announcing it](https://twitter.com/zack_overflow/status/1586288992680493057)
