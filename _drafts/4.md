### Paul Items

* 3D printing for good causes
  * [3D Printing for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Campaign](https://3dwithus.com/3d-printing-for-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention)
    * The idea was started by a teacher, Abby Brown, at Torrey Pines High School.  
    * Each year the school has Yellow Ribbon week where students are learn about crisis resources and risk factors for suicide.
    * The keychains were designed to give away to her students as a special way to end Yellow Ribbon Week.
    * Each keychain contains a word, such as "Smile", "Inspire", "Create", with about 10 different words.
    * There's a fundraising campaign where you can print one of the designs found on Cults3D and post it on Twitter and Facegram.
    * Different organizations are matching the funds, with an opportunity to raise over $4000 by just printing and sharing!
  * [https://www.ic3dprinters.com/2022-toys/](3D Printed Toys for Tots campaign)
    * Organized by IC3D in 2018, they work with volunteers in the 3D printing community to print toys for kids
      * Over 69,000 toys printed in 2021!
      * This year they have over 140 volunteers and have printed 27,000 toys so far.
      * You can donate financially or sign up to help print toys
      * Toys include an articulated alligator, a train engine, cars, low poly dinosaurs, and more.
    * The signup period is now over to volunteer for printing, but keep an eye out for this next year.

* macOS Ventura cannot copy UF2 files
  * [Adafruit Blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/)
  * [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/)
  * You cannot drag and drop UF2 and HEX files using macOS Finder - it results in an error
  * Two workarounds
    * Use the terminal: `cp -X blink.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/`
    * Install a macOS short created by Alasdair Allen (author of the Rasperry Pi blog post above)
      * [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/989b90c87fec4c11965dd517685f87cd)
      * Works great!  Update Shortcuts settings to allow shell scripts and just right click a UF2 image to transfer it
