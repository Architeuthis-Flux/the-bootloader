### More new IDEs - ViperIDE and Zed (Paul #1)

#### ViperIDE

Continuing my review of various IDEs, [ViperIDE](https://viper-ide.org/) is a brand new IDE in a web browser focused on MicroPython, with CircuitPython support created by Volodymyr Shymanskyy.  You can connect a board in a variety of ways including USB, Bluetooth, and you can use `WebREPL` to connect over the local network or even the internet.  It's a true IDE in a web browser with advanced features including syntax highlighting, auto expanding and minify of JSON, a terminal, and MicroPython package support.  It also features a full [MicroPython emulator](https://viper-ide.org/?vm=1) with an example and it uses MicroPython compiled to Web Assembly.

#### Zed

Zed is a fairly new code editor and IDE for macOS and Linux users who might miss Atom or Sublime Text.  It's open source, released under the Apache and GPL 3.0 licenses, and focused on speed and collaboration.

### CircuitMatter (Paul #2)

Matter is an open source standard managed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance for IoT devices. It requires a Matter controller such as some Google Nest devices, Apple Homepod or AppleTV, or some Amazon Echo devices.  For example, you can buy a Matter-supported smart bulb and set it up with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, or Amazon Alexaâ€”without having to worry about compatibility.

Scott Shawcroft, CircuitPython's lead developer, [shared he is working](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/2024/07/22/python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-python-was-at-risk-rp2040-chiplets-being-sold-and-much-more-circuitpython-python-micropython-thepsf-raspberry_pi/) on `CircuitMatter`, a pure Python implementation of some of the Matter specification that will be compatible with CircuitPython and potentially MicroPython.
