### More new IDEs - ViperIDE and Zed (Paul #1)

Continuing my review of various IDEs, [ViperIDE](https://viper-ide.org/) is a brand new IDE in a web browser focused on MicroPython, with CircuitPython support created by Volodymyr Shymanskyy.  You can connect a board in a variety of ways including USB, Bluetooth, and you can use `WebREPL` to connect over the local network or even the internet.  It's a true IDE in a web browser with advanced features including syntax highlighting, auto expanding and minify of JSON, a terminal, and MicroPython package support.  It also features a full [MicroPython emulator](https://viper-ide.org/?vm=1) with an example and it uses MicroPython compiled to Web Assembly.
