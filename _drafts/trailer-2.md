Talk Like a Pirate Day is Monday, September 19th

Paul: Hi, I’m Paul Cutler, host of The CircuitPython Show.

Tod: And I’m Tod Kurt.  Together we're bringing you The Bootloader, where we each share a few things we found interesting.

Tod: Paul, did you know it's International Talk Like a Pirate Day?

Paul: I did!

Tod: But did you know that CircuitPython has a pirate language you can install like any other foreign language?
