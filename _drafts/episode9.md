### PlumPot KiCad Tutorials

I have finally made the jump from Eagle to KiCad.  After 20 years of Eagle. 
A video series that really helped me was [PlumPot's video playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b). 

* [PlumPot KiCad Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b)
* PlumPot is Keri PLUMstead and JP POTgieter
* Goes from installing KiCad, to creating symbols & footprints to to ordering PCBs with gerber files
* An older series (KiCad 5), but still really helpful
* Because goes into some of the tricky details that haven't changed much, 
    like [adding 3d files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrOBbDDqE9w&list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b&index=5), [clearance & track rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF6PF0L4e-s&list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b&index=23), blind vias, differential pairs, and more
