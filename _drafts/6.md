### Hackaday Supercon

* What is [Hackaday Supercon](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/11/2022-supercon-more-talks-more-speakers/)?
  * Annual get together in Pasadena of talks & workshops on stuff you'd see in [Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/)
  * A way for me to see friends I've only really talk to online
  * It's held at the [Supplyframe DesignLab](https://supplyframe.com/designlab/)
     and at [Los Angeles College of Music](https://lacm.edu/) next door
  * In between is an alley where there's hardware hacking and snacks
  * The workshops are held at [Supplyframe HQ](https://supplyframe.com/), up the street a few blocks
  * One of my favorite conferences, before pandemic
  * This Supercon was first in-person since 2019
  * It was so nice seeing everyone, but wow I am out of practice being amongst people

* The SuperCon Badge
  * Hacker conferences have these "badges" that don't really function as IDs any more
  * Instead, they're a playground for electronics experimentation
  * This year, the badge was a microcontroller-based board that acted like an old switches-and-lights computer from the 1970s.
  * You program it the way computers used to be programed: hand keying in bits one-by-one, and clicking the "load" switch to enter a single machine code instruction, one at a time

* Some of the talks I liked
  * [Nick’s DIY Vacuum tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39-5WgcvaHk)
  * [Adrian’s Soviet chips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gZR1U2cF4)
  * [Chris Comb](https://chriscombs.net/artwork/all/)'s "How to Hang and Sell Your Blinky Goodness as Art"
      (on the DesignLab stage, so recorded but not streamed)
  * Also, [Bradley's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1IbAKz1qUY) aout 'showing up' and making a difference, disguised as a talk on hacking electric scooters
  * Also, [Samy's "random walk" exploration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6a25Smokkk) that resulted in a flexible wearable tesla coil to light up his breathe in a glass ampule
