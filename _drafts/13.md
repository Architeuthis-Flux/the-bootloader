### Maker (and more) Skill Trees (Paul #2)
Steph Piper aka Maker Queen has created [Maker Skill Trees](https://www.makerqueen.com.au/skill-trees-1) as a way to track your progress across a range of skills.  These include things like PCB Design, 3D Printing and Modeling, and Dev Boards to crafting skills like Crochet, Knitting and more.  There are almost sixty different skill treens to pick from.  Each skill tree has 73 skills or experience hexagon tiles, with basic skills at the bottom to more advanced skills at the top.

There's a [web app to create your own skill tree apps](https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTree-Generator/) designed by [Shane Gadsby](https://github.com/schme16).

There's also a book in development with an even more expansive range of skill trees, tools to track your pogress and calculate your life score across all areas.
