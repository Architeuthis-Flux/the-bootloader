## Liz's Pick (Liz #1)

### Raspberry Pi AI Camera Module (Tod #1)
Machine learning (oh I mean "AI") on the edge, at the device, rather than in the cloud.
ML models live in the camera and are delivered frame-synced alongside regular camera data.

### The Bumpin' Sticker by Guy Dupont (Paul #1)
Guy Dupont creates his take on the "Keep Honkin' I'm Listening to..." bumper stickers.  Using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, a screen from Ali Express, a Particle IoT board, and his Last.fm account, the screen dsiplays a bumper sticker with what Guy is currently listening to.

### X1Plus alternative open source Bambu X1 firmware (Tod #2)

### Maker (and more) Skill Trees (Paul #2)
Steph Piper aka Maker Queen has created [Maker Skill Trees](https://www.makerqueen.com.au/skill-trees-1) as a way to track your progress across a range of skills.  These include things like PCB Design, 3D Printing and Modeling, and Dev Boards to crafting skills like Crochet, Knitting and more.  There are almost sixty different skill treens to pick from.  Each skill tree has 73 skills or experience hexagon tiles, with basic skills at the bottom to more advanced skills at the top.

There's a [web app to create your own skill tree apps](https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTree-Generator/) designed by [Shane Gadsby](https://github.com/schme16).

There's also a book in development with an even more expansive range of skill trees, tools to track your pogress and calculate your life score across all areas.
